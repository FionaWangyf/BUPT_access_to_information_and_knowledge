The United States and Europe both last month announced the lifting of a wide raft of sanctions that had been slapped on Syria under the Assad dynasty's rule.\nLast week, Syria inked a power deal worth $7 billion with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish and U.S. companies for development of a 5,000-megawatt energy project to revitalize much of Syria's war-battered electricity grid.\nThe consortium led by Qatar's UCC Concession Investments — along with Power International USA and Turkey's Kalyon GES Enerji Yatirimlari, Cengiz Enerji — will develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar power plant.",

        "content": "Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, rips up a piece of paper that had plans from the Biden administration during a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nDEADHORSE, Alaska — President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \"big, beautiful twin,\" a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean.\nThe remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members — Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin — visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists.\nDuring the trip, Burgum's agency announced plans to repealBiden-era restrictionson future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.\nThe petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

        "content": "Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

        "content": "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security sign is displayed at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters on May 18 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Carter/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Department of Homeland Security removed a list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" days after the agency posted it on its website.\nThe list included dozens of cities and counties across 37 states and the District of Columbia that DHS said were innoncompliance with federal statutes.\n\"DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,\"the DHS page stated.\nThe list, which posted late last week and came down on Sunday, was supposed to be the latest step in the Trump administration's effort to push back against local municipalities that it believes are obstructing its goals to increase immigration-related arrests and deportations. Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

        "content": "Patricia Krenwinkel enters the superior court in Los Angeles for an arraignment in February 1970. Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

Candidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. He has mostly kept a double-digit lead inpollsover his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, throughout the race.\nBut whoever is elected, the new president will have little time for celebration.\nThe election comes nearly two months after President Yoon wasremoved from officeafter hisimpeachmentfor declaring martial law in the country. The intense confrontation both in the South Korean Parliament and among the public over Yoon's fateful act has aggravated the country's political polarization and shaken South Koreans' confidence in their democracy.\nLee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate for South Korea's Democratic Party, gestures onstage on Monday during his final election campaign event ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in Seoul.Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nAnd during the leadership vacuum, tariff threats from the Trump administration have intensified, and North Korea has grown closer with Russia.\nBoth of the leading candidates from the two major parties have pledged to unite the nation.\nBut they each represent South Korea's deepening division themselves.\nFront-runner Lee Jae-myung has clashed with Yoon's government as leader of the opposition, afterclosely losing to Yoonin the 2022 presidential election. Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

        "content": "James Henriksen with Colorado State University holds up a water sample for Harvard colleague Braden Tierney. The bag is teeming with microbes that they hope may help solve some of humanity's big problems.Ari Daniel/NPRhide caption\nThere are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.\nEvery few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.\n\"Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes\", saysJames Henriksen, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.\nHenriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. \"Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,\" he says, \"I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.\"\nThis uncanny ability of microbes \"tosurvive and thrivein these unusual places,\" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.\nOne of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is \"taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.\"\nSo they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.\n\"Microbes are nature's alchemists,\" saysBraden Tierney, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\"They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,\" he says. \"Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.\"\nThis allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.\nSeveral years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run acrossa studyfrom a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, \"just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,\" he says.\nAnd Tierney thought, \"Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2.\" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.\n\"We ended up almost immediatelyfinding a microorganismthat was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,\" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.\n\"To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,\" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.\nThis discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.\nSo he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit calledThe Two Frontiers Projectto search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.\nTheir mission is straightforward. \"We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,\" says Tierney.\nThe hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,\" says Henriksen.\nIn fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with \"a wide range of physiologies\" that are similarly \"unique and useful\" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.\nThe group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!\nAt Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.hide caption\n\"You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,\" saysChris Beuret, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBeuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractorBrian Orrhas filled entire buckets with \"this gelatinous glop.\" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to \"elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.\"\nHenriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across apaperthat \"had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.\"\nHe concluded that \"the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.\"\nAnd they may also beextremeenvironments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.\nThe Two Frontiers Project, in partnership with microbiome science company Seed and a global citizen science support platform called CitSci, is now reaching out tohomeowners nationwideto survey their domiciles for interesting goos. They've already received 120 inquiries, from which they've solicited 47 curious snots and brews.\nEmma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: \"It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.\"\nAs with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.\nKrista Ryonis the Director of Operations at The Two Frontiers Project where she runs the group's genomic sequencing. She says that certain colleagues of hers are charged with keeping the billions of cells they collect alive and growing. \"Whereas I immediately kill them where I open up the cells and I extract the DNA out of them,\" she says. \"But we do that in order to form this picture of this community that's in the entire sample.\"\nThere's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.\n\"Microbes are amazing at what they do,\" saysLisa Stein, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. \"But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?\"\nFor instance, \"once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,\" saysHolly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, \"the carbon has to go somewhere,\" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.\nThe approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is \"a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.\"\nBut Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. \"Kudos to them for having that idea,\" she says. \"That's pretty innovative right there.\" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. \"I'm glad they're looking into it,\" she says. \"I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.\"\nStill, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.\nBack at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. \"We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,\" he says, \"not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.\"\nHe enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.\n\"I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,\" says Henriksen. \"You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover.\"",

The idea sprung from his work in Houston the year prior with kids displaced byHurricane Harvey. He said camp counselors are uniquely equipped to care for children in the wake of natural disasters. The camp's approach, Latner said, is rooted in research showing thatadverse childhood experiencesare linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems.\n\"By providing that sense of safety and normalcy at camp, we can help to lower their stress levels, return them to a routine, and only then can they start to create a narrative around what has happened … so that they understand that something has happened and that they're safe now — to end that uncertainty and fear,\" Latner said.\nProject:Camp founder Mikey Latner talks to a camper.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nCampers do handstands on the soccer field at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWith its first camp up and running three days after the Palisades fire ignited on Jan. 7, Project:Camp ended up putting ona total of 10 camps throughout the region, welcoming 5- to 16-year-olds.

The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

        "content": "Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

        "content": "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security sign is displayed at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters on May 18 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Carter/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Department of Homeland Security removed a list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" days after the agency posted it on its website.\nThe list included dozens of cities and counties across 37 states and the District of Columbia that DHS said were innoncompliance with federal statutes.\n\"DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,\"the DHS page stated.\nThe list, which posted late last week and came down on Sunday, was supposed to be the latest step in the Trump administration's effort to push back against local municipalities that it believes are obstructing its goals to increase immigration-related arrests and deportations. Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

Candidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. He has mostly kept a double-digit lead inpollsover his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, throughout the race.\nBut whoever is elected, the new president will have little time for celebration.\nThe election comes nearly two months after President Yoon wasremoved from officeafter hisimpeachmentfor declaring martial law in the country. The intense confrontation both in the South Korean Parliament and among the public over Yoon's fateful act has aggravated the country's political polarization and shaken South Koreans' confidence in their democracy.\nLee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate for South Korea's Democratic Party, gestures onstage on Monday during his final election campaign event ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in Seoul.Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nAnd during the leadership vacuum, tariff threats from the Trump administration have intensified, and North Korea has grown closer with Russia.\nBoth of the leading candidates from the two major parties have pledged to unite the nation.\nBut they each represent South Korea's deepening division themselves.\nFront-runner Lee Jae-myung has clashed with Yoon's government as leader of the opposition, afterclosely losing to Yoonin the 2022 presidential election. Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

        "content": "James Henriksen with Colorado State University holds up a water sample for Harvard colleague Braden Tierney. The bag is teeming with microbes that they hope may help solve some of humanity's big problems.Ari Daniel/NPRhide caption\nThere are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.\nEvery few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.\n\"Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes\", saysJames Henriksen, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.\nHenriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. \"Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,\" he says, \"I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.\"\nThis uncanny ability of microbes \"tosurvive and thrivein these unusual places,\" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.\nOne of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is \"taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.\"\nSo they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.\n\"Microbes are nature's alchemists,\" saysBraden Tierney, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\"They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,\" he says. \"Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.\"\nThis allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.\nSeveral years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run acrossa studyfrom a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, \"just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,\" he says.\nAnd Tierney thought, \"Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2.\" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.\n\"We ended up almost immediatelyfinding a microorganismthat was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,\" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.\n\"To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,\" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.\nThis discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.\nSo he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit calledThe Two Frontiers Projectto search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.\nTheir mission is straightforward. \"We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,\" says Tierney.\nThe hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,\" says Henriksen.\nIn fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with \"a wide range of physiologies\" that are similarly \"unique and useful\" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.\nThe group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!\nAt Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.hide caption\n\"You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,\" saysChris Beuret, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBeuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractorBrian Orrhas filled entire buckets with \"this gelatinous glop.\" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to \"elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.\"\nHenriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across apaperthat \"had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.\"\nHe concluded that \"the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.\"\nAnd they may also beextremeenvironments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.\nThe Two Frontiers Project, in partnership with microbiome science company Seed and a global citizen science support platform called CitSci, is now reaching out tohomeowners nationwideto survey their domiciles for interesting goos. They've already received 120 inquiries, from which they've solicited 47 curious snots and brews.\nEmma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: \"It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.\"\nAs with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.\nKrista Ryonis the Director of Operations at The Two Frontiers Project where she runs the group's genomic sequencing. She says that certain colleagues of hers are charged with keeping the billions of cells they collect alive and growing. \"Whereas I immediately kill them where I open up the cells and I extract the DNA out of them,\" she says. \"But we do that in order to form this picture of this community that's in the entire sample.\"\nThere's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.\n\"Microbes are amazing at what they do,\" saysLisa Stein, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. \"But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?\"\nFor instance, \"once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,\" saysHolly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, \"the carbon has to go somewhere,\" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.\nThe approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is \"a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.\"\nBut Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. \"Kudos to them for having that idea,\" she says. \"That's pretty innovative right there.\" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. \"I'm glad they're looking into it,\" she says. \"I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.\"\nStill, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.\nBack at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. \"We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,\" he says, \"not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.\"\nHe enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.\n\"I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,\" says Henriksen. \"You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover.\"",

Since the fires, she said, parents have reached out to her seeking therapy for their kids after noticing signs of emotional and physical distress tied to the tragedy. Some kids are experiencing an increase in panic or nightmares, are more prone to separation anxiety and mood swings, while others appear unaffected, according to O'Malley.\n\"Their sense of safety, stability — that was all rocked,\" she said.\nFor kids who experience a natural disaster, O'Malley said, it helps to find some sense of normalcy to begin the healing process.\nEmory Stumme enjoys lunch with her camp group at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nBecca said Emory's time at the camp gave her daughter a chance to connect with friends while her school was paused.\n\"The first day that we picked her up from camp, I was like, 'Oh this is the old kid again,' \" Stumme said. \"She was able to see her friends and be outside and play and just be a kid and not have to worry about, like, 'Where are we staying tonight?' or 'What clothes do I have?' \"\nThe Eakin family in their temporary home in El Sereno, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nMarah Eakin said sending her 6-year-old twins to the camp gave her some much-needed space to process her own feelings and handle \"grown-up stuff,\" like insurance paperwork.\nThe Eakin family has been bouncing from one short-term rental to another. The home they had rented in Altadena still stands, about 100 feet outside of the burn scar of the Eaton fire. But, while they work to get their landlord to clean the place of ash and potentially other toxic chemicals, she said it's unclear if or when they'll be able to return.\nThe Eakin family poses for a portrait down the street from their temporary home in El Sereno, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWhen Marah's kids' school resumed, not all of their classmates returned, the mother said. \"A lot of their friends are scattered to the wind,\" she said.\nHer daughter Zella misses her stuffed animals that got left behind.\nWhat might seem to some like an insignificant loss is often no small thing to a child struggling to cope with such losses, O'Malley said. Whether it's stuffed animals or the family pet, the therapist said, kids grieve all kinds of things that might shape their sense of who they are.\nEugene and Zella Eakin play with stuffed animals in their temporary home in El Sereno, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\n\"The biggest thing I think that comes up in grief work is when something changes your identity,\" she said. \"Oh, I have seven guinea pigs, six of them are hairless — that's my fun fact — and one of my guinea pigs died last month, and I keep going, do I have to say six now instead of seven? It changes the way you introduce yourself, it changes so much about your identity, to have these shifts.\"\nChildren ultimately guide the program at Project:Camp, O'Malley said, while the adults allow them the space to talk through feelings that might arise throughout the day. There are frequent mental wellness checks, during which kids are encouraged to pick a number representing their feelings, in a 1 to 10 range. \"\"Gratitude circles\" invite kids to share what makes them grateful; sometimes they are thankful for the food, or seeing friends. Through exercises like this, the camp's program can give kids opportunities to have their own story heard, said O'Malley.\nProject:Camp counselor Becca Grae and Zella Eakin in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\n\"When somebody else goes, 'Oh, this all happened for a reason' — it's not for someone else to tell you what your experience was,\" she said. \"That can be really diminishing. But when you yourself make meaning of an event, that can be very powerful.\"\nOften, the healing — sharing their feelings, telling their story — happens during the in-between moments, she said.\n\"You're like, 'Does anyone need to share?' And people are like, 'No, we want to get to lunch,' \" O'Malley said. \"And then on the way to lunch, somebody goes, 'Oh wow, this reminds me of my kitchen that had this really beautiful tile in it, and I'm sad that tile's gone. That was really meaningful to my family — Oh yay, hot dogs!' \"",

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, rips up a piece of paper that had plans from the Biden administration during a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nDEADHORSE, Alaska — President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \"big, beautiful twin,\" a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean.\nThe remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members — Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin — visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists.\nDuring the trip, Burgum's agency announced plans to repealBiden-era restrictionson future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.\nThe petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

        "content": "Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

        "content": "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security sign is displayed at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters on May 18 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Carter/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Department of Homeland Security removed a list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" days after the agency posted it on its website.\nThe list included dozens of cities and counties across 37 states and the District of Columbia that DHS said were innoncompliance with federal statutes.\n\"DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,\"the DHS page stated.\nThe list, which posted late last week and came down on Sunday, was supposed to be the latest step in the Trump administration's effort to push back against local municipalities that it believes are obstructing its goals to increase immigration-related arrests and deportations. Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

Candidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. He has mostly kept a double-digit lead inpollsover his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, throughout the race.\nBut whoever is elected, the new president will have little time for celebration.\nThe election comes nearly two months after President Yoon wasremoved from officeafter hisimpeachmentfor declaring martial law in the country. The intense confrontation both in the South Korean Parliament and among the public over Yoon's fateful act has aggravated the country's political polarization and shaken South Koreans' confidence in their democracy.\nLee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate for South Korea's Democratic Party, gestures onstage on Monday during his final election campaign event ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in Seoul.Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nAnd during the leadership vacuum, tariff threats from the Trump administration have intensified, and North Korea has grown closer with Russia.\nBoth of the leading candidates from the two major parties have pledged to unite the nation.\nBut they each represent South Korea's deepening division themselves.\nFront-runner Lee Jae-myung has clashed with Yoon's government as leader of the opposition, afterclosely losing to Yoonin the 2022 presidential election. Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

The bag is teeming with microbes that they hope may help solve some of humanity's big problems.Ari Daniel/NPRhide caption\nThere are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.\nEvery few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.\n\"Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes\", saysJames Henriksen, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.\nHenriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. \"Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,\" he says, \"I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.\"\nThis uncanny ability of microbes \"tosurvive and thrivein these unusual places,\" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.\nOne of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is \"taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.\"\nSo they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.\n\"Microbes are nature's alchemists,\" saysBraden Tierney, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\"They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,\" he says. \"Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.\"\nThis allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.\nSeveral years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run acrossa studyfrom a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, \"just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,\" he says.\nAnd Tierney thought, \"Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2.\" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.\n\"We ended up almost immediatelyfinding a microorganismthat was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,\" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.\n\"To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,\" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.\nThis discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.\nSo he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit calledThe Two Frontiers Projectto search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.\nTheir mission is straightforward. \"We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,\" says Tierney.\nThe hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,\" says Henriksen.\nIn fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with \"a wide range of physiologies\" that are similarly \"unique and useful\" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.\nThe group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!\nAt Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.hide caption\n\"You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,\" saysChris Beuret, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBeuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractorBrian Orrhas filled entire buckets with \"this gelatinous glop.\" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to \"elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.\"\nHenriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across apaperthat \"had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.\"\nHe concluded that \"the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.\"\nAnd they may also beextremeenvironments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.\nThe Two Frontiers Project, in partnership with microbiome science company Seed and a global citizen science support platform called CitSci, is now reaching out tohomeowners nationwideto survey their domiciles for interesting goos. They've already received 120 inquiries, from which they've solicited 47 curious snots and brews.\nEmma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: \"It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.\"\nAs with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.\nKrista Ryonis the Director of Operations at The Two Frontiers Project where she runs the group's genomic sequencing. She says that certain colleagues of hers are charged with keeping the billions of cells they collect alive and growing. \"Whereas I immediately kill them where I open up the cells and I extract the DNA out of them,\" she says. \"But we do that in order to form this picture of this community that's in the entire sample.\"\nThere's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.\n\"Microbes are amazing at what they do,\" saysLisa Stein, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. \"But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?\"\nFor instance, \"once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,\" saysHolly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, \"the carbon has to go somewhere,\" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.\nThe approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is \"a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.\"\nBut Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. \"Kudos to them for having that idea,\" she says. \"That's pretty innovative right there.\" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. \"I'm glad they're looking into it,\" she says. \"I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.\"\nStill, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.\nBack at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. \"We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,\" he says, \"not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.\"\nHe enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.\n\"I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,\" says Henriksen. \"You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover.\"",

The idea sprung from his work in Houston the year prior with kids displaced byHurricane Harvey. He said camp counselors are uniquely equipped to care for children in the wake of natural disasters. The camp's approach, Latner said, is rooted in research showing thatadverse childhood experiencesare linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems.\n\"By providing that sense of safety and normalcy at camp, we can help to lower their stress levels, return them to a routine, and only then can they start to create a narrative around what has happened … so that they understand that something has happened and that they're safe now — to end that uncertainty and fear,\" Latner said.\nProject:Camp founder Mikey Latner talks to a camper.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nCampers do handstands on the soccer field at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWith its first camp up and running three days after the Palisades fire ignited on Jan. 7, Project:Camp ended up putting ona total of 10 camps throughout the region, welcoming 5- to 16-year-olds.

The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

        "content": "Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

        "content": "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security sign is displayed at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters on May 18 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Carter/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Department of Homeland Security removed a list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" days after the agency posted it on its website.\nThe list included dozens of cities and counties across 37 states and the District of Columbia that DHS said were innoncompliance with federal statutes.\n\"DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,\"the DHS page stated.\nThe list, which posted late last week and came down on Sunday, was supposed to be the latest step in the Trump administration's effort to push back against local municipalities that it believes are obstructing its goals to increase immigration-related arrests and deportations. Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

        "content": "Patricia Krenwinkel enters the superior court in Los Angeles for an arraignment in February 1970. Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

Candidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. He has mostly kept a double-digit lead inpollsover his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, throughout the race.\nBut whoever is elected, the new president will have little time for celebration.\nThe election comes nearly two months after President Yoon wasremoved from officeafter hisimpeachmentfor declaring martial law in the country. The intense confrontation both in the South Korean Parliament and among the public over Yoon's fateful act has aggravated the country's political polarization and shaken South Koreans' confidence in their democracy.\nLee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate for South Korea's Democratic Party, gestures onstage on Monday during his final election campaign event ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in Seoul.Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nAnd during the leadership vacuum, tariff threats from the Trump administration have intensified, and North Korea has grown closer with Russia.\nBoth of the leading candidates from the two major parties have pledged to unite the nation.\nBut they each represent South Korea's deepening division themselves.\nFront-runner Lee Jae-myung has clashed with Yoon's government as leader of the opposition, afterclosely losing to Yoonin the 2022 presidential election. Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

        "content": "James Henriksen with Colorado State University holds up a water sample for Harvard colleague Braden Tierney. The bag is teeming with microbes that they hope may help solve some of humanity's big problems.Ari Daniel/NPRhide caption\nThere are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.\nEvery few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.\n\"Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes\", saysJames Henriksen, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.\nHenriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. \"Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,\" he says, \"I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.\"\nThis uncanny ability of microbes \"tosurvive and thrivein these unusual places,\" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.\nOne of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is \"taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.\"\nSo they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.\n\"Microbes are nature's alchemists,\" saysBraden Tierney, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\"They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,\" he says. \"Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.\"\nThis allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.\nSeveral years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run acrossa studyfrom a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, \"just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,\" he says.\nAnd Tierney thought, \"Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2.\" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.\n\"We ended up almost immediatelyfinding a microorganismthat was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,\" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.\n\"To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,\" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.\nThis discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.\nSo he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit calledThe Two Frontiers Projectto search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.\nTheir mission is straightforward. \"We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,\" says Tierney.\nThe hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,\" says Henriksen.\nIn fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with \"a wide range of physiologies\" that are similarly \"unique and useful\" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.\nThe group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!\nAt Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.hide caption\n\"You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,\" saysChris Beuret, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBeuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractorBrian Orrhas filled entire buckets with \"this gelatinous glop.\" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to \"elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.\"\nHenriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across apaperthat \"had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.\"\nHe concluded that \"the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.\"\nAnd they may also beextremeenvironments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.\nThe Two Frontiers Project, in partnership with microbiome science company Seed and a global citizen science support platform called CitSci, is now reaching out tohomeowners nationwideto survey their domiciles for interesting goos. They've already received 120 inquiries, from which they've solicited 47 curious snots and brews.\nEmma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: \"It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.\"\nAs with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.\nKrista Ryonis the Director of Operations at The Two Frontiers Project where she runs the group's genomic sequencing. She says that certain colleagues of hers are charged with keeping the billions of cells they collect alive and growing. \"Whereas I immediately kill them where I open up the cells and I extract the DNA out of them,\" she says. \"But we do that in order to form this picture of this community that's in the entire sample.\"\nThere's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.\n\"Microbes are amazing at what they do,\" saysLisa Stein, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. \"But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?\"\nFor instance, \"once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,\" saysHolly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, \"the carbon has to go somewhere,\" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.\nThe approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is \"a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.\"\nBut Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. \"Kudos to them for having that idea,\" she says. \"That's pretty innovative right there.\" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. \"I'm glad they're looking into it,\" she says. \"I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.\"\nStill, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.\nBack at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. \"We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,\" he says, \"not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.\"\nHe enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.\n\"I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,\" says Henriksen. \"You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover.\"",

The tears came during a family dinner, and she struggled to catch her breath.\n\"You just were like, 'I can't pick up this fork, it's too heavy,' \" Emory's mother, Becca, told her, recounting the episode. \"You started crying and laughing and crying, and then heaving.

It was part of a series of free day camps in Southern California organized by Project:Camp, which aims to provide some normalcy for children displaced by disaster.\nCounselors and kids join together on the soccer field as the Project:Camp day begins at Camp Bob Waldorf in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nMikey Latner founded Project:Camp in 2018, inspired by what he saw as a need to help kids cope with their stress when their routines are disrupted. The idea sprung from his work in Houston the year prior with kids displaced byHurricane Harvey. He said camp counselors are uniquely equipped to care for children in the wake of natural disasters. The camp's approach, Latner said, is rooted in research showing thatadverse childhood experiencesare linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems.\n\"By providing that sense of safety and normalcy at camp, we can help to lower their stress levels, return them to a routine, and only then can they start to create a narrative around what has happened … so that they understand that something has happened and that they're safe now — to end that uncertainty and fear,\" Latner said.\nProject:Camp founder Mikey Latner talks to a camper.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nCampers do handstands on the soccer field at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWith its first camp up and running three days after the Palisades fire ignited on Jan. 7, Project:Camp ended up putting ona total of 10 camps throughout the region, welcoming 5- to 16-year-olds. Many of the camps lasted for two or three weeks.\nThe program offered typical day camp activities such as arts and crafts, and games like tag. Other activities drew more directly from the camp's trauma-informed approach.

Since the fires, she said, parents have reached out to her seeking therapy for their kids after noticing signs of emotional and physical distress tied to the tragedy. Some kids are experiencing an increase in panic or nightmares, are more prone to separation anxiety and mood swings, while others appear unaffected, according to O'Malley.\n\"Their sense of safety, stability — that was all rocked,\" she said.\nFor kids who experience a natural disaster, O'Malley said, it helps to find some sense of normalcy to begin the healing process.\nEmory Stumme enjoys lunch with her camp group at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nBecca said Emory's time at the camp gave her daughter a chance to connect with friends while her school was paused.\n\"The first day that we picked her up from camp, I was like, 'Oh this is the old kid again,' \" Stumme said. \"She was able to see her friends and be outside and play and just be a kid and not have to worry about, like, 'Where are we staying tonight?' or 'What clothes do I have?' \"\nThe Eakin family in their temporary home in El Sereno, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nMarah Eakin said sending her 6-year-old twins to the camp gave her some much-needed space to process her own feelings and handle \"grown-up stuff,\" like insurance paperwork.\nThe Eakin family has been bouncing from one short-term rental to another. The home they had rented in Altadena still stands, about 100 feet outside of the burn scar of the Eaton fire.

It changes the way you introduce yourself, it changes so much about your identity, to have these shifts.\"\nChildren ultimately guide the program at Project:Camp, O'Malley said, while the adults allow them the space to talk through feelings that might arise throughout the day. There are frequent mental wellness checks, during which kids are encouraged to pick a number representing their feelings, in a 1 to 10 range. \"\"Gratitude circles\" invite kids to share what makes them grateful; sometimes they are thankful for the food, or seeing friends.

And people are like, 'No, we want to get to lunch,' \" O'Malley said. \"And then on the way to lunch, somebody goes, 'Oh wow, this reminds me of my kitchen that had this really beautiful tile in it, and I'm sad that tile's gone.

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, rips up a piece of paper that had plans from the Biden administration during a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nDEADHORSE, Alaska — President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \"big, beautiful twin,\" a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean.\nThe remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members — Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin — visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists.\nDuring the trip, Burgum's agency announced plans to repealBiden-era restrictionson future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.\nThe petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

        "content": "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security sign is displayed at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters on May 18 in Washington, D.C.Kevin Carter/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Department of Homeland Security removed a list of \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" days after the agency posted it on its website.\nThe list included dozens of cities and counties across 37 states and the District of Columbia that DHS said were innoncompliance with federal statutes.\n\"DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,\"the DHS page stated.\nThe list, which posted late last week and came down on Sunday, was supposed to be the latest step in the Trump administration's effort to push back against local municipalities that it believes are obstructing its goals to increase immigration-related arrests and deportations. Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

        "content": "James Henriksen with Colorado State University holds up a water sample for Harvard colleague Braden Tierney. The bag is teeming with microbes that they hope may help solve some of humanity's big problems.Ari Daniel/NPRhide caption\nThere are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.\nEvery few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.\n\"Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes\", saysJames Henriksen, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.\nHenriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. \"Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,\" he says, \"I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.\"\nThis uncanny ability of microbes \"tosurvive and thrivein these unusual places,\" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.\nOne of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is \"taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.\"\nSo they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.\n\"Microbes are nature's alchemists,\" saysBraden Tierney, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\"They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,\" he says. \"Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.\"\nThis allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.\nSeveral years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run acrossa studyfrom a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, \"just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,\" he says.\nAnd Tierney thought, \"Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2.\" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.\n\"We ended up almost immediatelyfinding a microorganismthat was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,\" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.\n\"To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,\" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.\nThis discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.\nSo he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit calledThe Two Frontiers Projectto search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.\nTheir mission is straightforward. \"We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,\" says Tierney.\nThe hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,\" says Henriksen.\nIn fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with \"a wide range of physiologies\" that are similarly \"unique and useful\" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.\nThe group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!\nAt Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.hide caption\n\"You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,\" saysChris Beuret, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBeuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractorBrian Orrhas filled entire buckets with \"this gelatinous glop.\" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to \"elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.\"\nHenriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across apaperthat \"had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.\"\nHe concluded that \"the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.\"\nAnd they may also beextremeenvironments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.\nThe Two Frontiers Project, in partnership with microbiome science company Seed and a global citizen science support platform called CitSci, is now reaching out tohomeowners nationwideto survey their domiciles for interesting goos. They've already received 120 inquiries, from which they've solicited 47 curious snots and brews.\nEmma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: \"It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.\"\nAs with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.\nKrista Ryonis the Director of Operations at The Two Frontiers Project where she runs the group's genomic sequencing. She says that certain colleagues of hers are charged with keeping the billions of cells they collect alive and growing. \"Whereas I immediately kill them where I open up the cells and I extract the DNA out of them,\" she says. \"But we do that in order to form this picture of this community that's in the entire sample.\"\nThere's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.\n\"Microbes are amazing at what they do,\" saysLisa Stein, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. \"But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?\"\nFor instance, \"once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,\" saysHolly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, \"the carbon has to go somewhere,\" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.\nThe approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is \"a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.\"\nBut Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. \"Kudos to them for having that idea,\" she says. \"That's pretty innovative right there.\" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. \"I'm glad they're looking into it,\" she says. \"I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.\"\nStill, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.\nBack at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. \"We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,\" he says, \"not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.\"\nHe enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.\n\"I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,\" says Henriksen. \"You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover.\"",

The camp's approach, Latner said, is rooted in research showing thatadverse childhood experiencesare linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems.\n\"By providing that sense of safety and normalcy at camp, we can help to lower their stress levels, return them to a routine, and only then can they start to create a narrative around what has happened … so that they understand that something has happened and that they're safe now — to end that uncertainty and fear,\" Latner said.\nProject:Camp founder Mikey Latner talks to a camper.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nCampers do handstands on the soccer field at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWith its first camp up and running three days after the Palisades fire ignited on Jan. 7, Project:Camp ended up putting ona total of 10 camps throughout the region, welcoming 5- to 16-year-olds.

The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

        "content": "Patricia Krenwinkel enters the superior court in Los Angeles for an arraignment in February 1970. Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

Candidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. He has mostly kept a double-digit lead inpollsover his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, throughout the race.\nBut whoever is elected, the new president will have little time for celebration.\nThe election comes nearly two months after President Yoon wasremoved from officeafter hisimpeachmentfor declaring martial law in the country. The intense confrontation both in the South Korean Parliament and among the public over Yoon's fateful act has aggravated the country's political polarization and shaken South Koreans' confidence in their democracy.\nLee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate for South Korea's Democratic Party, gestures onstage on Monday during his final election campaign event ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in Seoul.Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nAnd during the leadership vacuum, tariff threats from the Trump administration have intensified, and North Korea has grown closer with Russia.\nBoth of the leading candidates from the two major parties have pledged to unite the nation.\nBut they each represent South Korea's deepening division themselves.\nFront-runner Lee Jae-myung has clashed with Yoon's government as leader of the opposition, afterclosely losing to Yoonin the 2022 presidential election. Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

        "content": "James Henriksen with Colorado State University holds up a water sample for Harvard colleague Braden Tierney. The bag is teeming with microbes that they hope may help solve some of humanity's big problems.Ari Daniel/NPRhide caption\nThere are places where the Earth's inner rumblings burble to the surface — like Iron Spring, located just outside the bustling town of Manitou Springs in central Colorado.\nEvery few seconds, a burst of water surges out of a narrow pipe, splashing into a concrete basin that's partly dyed a bright orange.\n\"Whenever I see that color, I look very carefully because sometimes it's not chemistry that's forming that rust. It's biology — an entire world of unexplored and undiscovered microbes\", saysJames Henriksen, an environmental microbiologist at Colorado State University.\nHenriksen uses a metal file to sample the microorganisms teeming invisibly and improbably in the colorful puddles atop the basin. \"Just like birders are constantly looking for birds,\" he says, \"I'm constantly looking around for evidence of the things that we can't see — the microbes that are everywhere.\"\nThis uncanny ability of microbes \"tosurvive and thrivein these unusual places,\" says Henriksen, got him wondering whether these miniscule organisms may hold the solutions to some of humanity's biggest problems.\nOne of Henriksen's former undergraduate students and current lab members, Kyndal Prahl, explains the idea is \"taking the smallest parts of the world that you can't even see and manipulating these microbes for a bigger purpose.\"\nSo they and a small team of researchers have set out on the tiniest of treasure hunts to find remarkable microbes that can help bail us out of our many messes — and it's led them to places both remote and rather familiar.\n\"Microbes are nature's alchemists,\" saysBraden Tierney, a microbiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\"They are capable of taking just about any compound or chemical anywhere in the world and turning it into something else to survive,\" he says. \"Basically, they're transforming all the stuff that we might see as inert, metallic or wasteful into something that they can use to live.\"\nThis allows microbes to thrive in some of the most inhospitable places imaginable — like under high pressures or in the super cold or where it's really salty. The microorganisms living in these challenging environments are called extremophiles.\nSeveral years back, Tierney began wondering whether he could harness these remarkable abilities of microbes somehow. He had run acrossa studyfrom a bay next to the Aeolian island of Vulcano off Sicily, containing a series of shallow, volcanic vents, \"just spewing carbon dioxide naturally into the ocean,\" he says.\nAnd Tierney thought, \"Wow, I'll bet there are microbes there that are really good at consuming CO2.\" So he and a small team joined up with the Sicilian scientists to return to the bay to sample the water for microbes.\n\"We ended up almost immediatelyfinding a microorganismthat was remarkably efficient at consuming carbon dioxide,\" he says. They affectionately call it Chonkus.\n\"To put it very simply, it grows fast and it sinks,\" says Tierney. And that means that Chonkus absorbs more carbon dioxide and then drops to the bottom where it can be collected and disposed of easily. This made it an ideal candidate for scaling up to, perhaps, one day, suck down large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air.\nThis discovery encouraged Tierney to believe that there must be other microbes out there doing any number of untold, remarkable things that humans could make use of.\nSo he and Henriksen co-founded a non-profit calledThe Two Frontiers Projectto search for microorganisms that might pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to help mitigate climate change, grow crops in hostile environments, help dying corals mount a comeback, capture rare earth metals for human use and clean up hazardous waste sites.\nTheir mission is straightforward. \"We travel to sites all around the world where there is microbial life,\" says Tierney.\nThe hunt has taken the team to coral reefs in the Red Sea, the soils of the Mojave desert, springs across Colorado, and the volcanic vents off Papua New Guinea. \"Unusual places can be some of the most interesting places to discover something different,\" says Henriksen.\nIn fact, Tierney says he and his team have already isolated microbes with \"a wide range of physiologies\" that are similarly \"unique and useful\" to Chonkus. That includes other bacteria that are capable of grabbing carbon out of the air and still others associated with corals that appear to produce antibiotics.\nThe group suspects there are more helpful microbes out there, but they're thinking they may not need to travel quite so far to find places that are unusual. They've now turned their attention — to people's homes!\nAt Colorado State University, Jacob Hall and Emma Lopez work on a set of recently collected samples while Kyndal Prahl looks on. All three have spent a portion of their undergraduate years collecting and analyzing microbes.hide caption\n\"You run into the slimes and goops everywhere in my profession,\" saysChris Beuret, who teaches construction management at Colorado State University and worked in maintenance facilities for years, including Colorado, California and on ships in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBeuret says he's seen innumerable pipes clog and drip pans fill with goo, which are often the telltale accumulations of microbes. The character of the slime varies by geography. For instance, in Florida, HVAC contractorBrian Orrhas filled entire buckets with \"this gelatinous glop.\" Recently, due to changes from copper to aluminum tubing, he and his team started observing something more akin to \"elephant snot — a clear or white sort of goo that would build up really, really fast.\"\nHenriksen first got the idea to search these sludges in the nooks and crannies of homes for microbial heroes when he ran across apaperthat \"had to be horrifying for the person and hilarious for the scientists. This person had slimy tentacles that kept growing back out of their showerhead.\"\nHe concluded that \"the weird slimy things in showerheads, stuff growing in dishwashers, and hot water heaters, they're really strange environments.\"\nAnd they may also beextremeenvironments as well, which could have pressured microbes into finding ways of grabbing carbon out of their surroundings to grow and survive. In other words, maybe something that holds a secret to reducing CO2 levels — is your roommate.\nThe Two Frontiers Project, in partnership with microbiome science company Seed and a global citizen science support platform called CitSci, is now reaching out tohomeowners nationwideto survey their domiciles for interesting goos. They've already received 120 inquiries, from which they've solicited 47 curious snots and brews.\nEmma Lopez, a rising senior at Colorado State University who works in Henriksen's lab, puts it like this: \"It's the idea that anyone can be a microbiologist.\"\nAs with all their samples, the researchers will sequence the DNA of these microbes to census the organisms, search for new species, and determine whether any of them might be useful to humans.\nKrista Ryonis the Director of Operations at The Two Frontiers Project where she runs the group's genomic sequencing. She says that certain colleagues of hers are charged with keeping the billions of cells they collect alive and growing. \"Whereas I immediately kill them where I open up the cells and I extract the DNA out of them,\" she says. \"But we do that in order to form this picture of this community that's in the entire sample.\"\nThere's still a ways to go, however. Even if they are able to find another microbe or two with a superpower that humans can take advantage of, there's no guarantee these microorganisms can then be put to use to actually help.\n\"Microbes are amazing at what they do,\" saysLisa Stein, a climate change microbiologist at the University of Alberta. \"But can we get their processes into a system that's economically competitive that we can scale and deploy?\"\nFor instance, \"once you have a microbe that eats carbon, you still have to do something with it,\" saysHolly Jean Buck, an environmental social scientist at the University at Buffalo. Even if a microbe can trap carbon, \"the carbon has to go somewhere,\" she says. There are a range of potential destinations, including mineralizing it as rock, storing it in the soil, or using it to produce fuels, but these are at different stages of development.\nThe approach that The Two Frontiers Project is taking, along with other groups doing similar work, isn't entirely new. Stein says scientists have bio-prospected for novel microorganisms for decades. In her view, this is \"a shot in the dark because we have extensively covered many of these ecosystems in the past.\"\nBut Stein acknowledges that microbes are constantly evolving, especially in the face of a changing climate. And she hasn't seen anyone sample in homes like this before. \"Kudos to them for having that idea,\" she says. \"That's pretty innovative right there.\" Buck agrees that the effort is worth serious consideration. \"I'm glad they're looking into it,\" she says. \"I think all innovation involves some amount of uncertainty around what will pay off.\"\nStill, the best way to bring down CO2 levels probably won't be found in your shower head, but by reducing emissions. Carbon capture efforts have so far proved to be energy-intensive and difficult to scale.\nBack at Colorado State University, Henriksen agrees that the path from microbial discovery to widespread deployment is a long one. \"We have to be focused on things that can work in the real world,\" he says, \"not just discovering organisms that are interesting for their own sake.\"\nHe enters the walk-in refrigerator where he stores all the samples that he and the team have collected — from the volcanic vents and mineral springs half a world away to the condensation tubes and freezer drip lines in people's homes. It's a living library of microbes.\n\"I look at these shelves of little tubes and each one I know is just packed with DNA or microorganisms that can do amazing things,\" says Henriksen. \"You just have to go out and explore — go out and discover.\"",

The idea sprung from his work in Houston the year prior with kids displaced byHurricane Harvey. He said camp counselors are uniquely equipped to care for children in the wake of natural disasters. The camp's approach, Latner said, is rooted in research showing thatadverse childhood experiencesare linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems.\n\"By providing that sense of safety and normalcy at camp, we can help to lower their stress levels, return them to a routine, and only then can they start to create a narrative around what has happened … so that they understand that something has happened and that they're safe now — to end that uncertainty and fear,\" Latner said.\nProject:Camp founder Mikey Latner talks to a camper.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nCampers do handstands on the soccer field at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWith its first camp up and running three days after the Palisades fire ignited on Jan. 7, Project:Camp ended up putting ona total of 10 camps throughout the region, welcoming 5- to 16-year-olds.

Since the fires, she said, parents have reached out to her seeking therapy for their kids after noticing signs of emotional and physical distress tied to the tragedy. Some kids are experiencing an increase in panic or nightmares, are more prone to separation anxiety and mood swings, while others appear unaffected, according to O'Malley.\n\"Their sense of safety, stability — that was all rocked,\" she said.\nFor kids who experience a natural disaster, O'Malley said, it helps to find some sense of normalcy to begin the healing process.\nEmory Stumme enjoys lunch with her camp group at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nBecca said Emory's time at the camp gave her daughter a chance to connect with friends while her school was paused.\n\"The first day that we picked her up from camp, I was like, 'Oh this is the old kid again,' \" Stumme said. \"She was able to see her friends and be outside and play and just be a kid and not have to worry about, like, 'Where are we staying tonight?' or 'What clothes do I have?' \"\nThe Eakin family in their temporary home in El Sereno, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nMarah Eakin said sending her 6-year-old twins to the camp gave her some much-needed space to process her own feelings and handle \"grown-up stuff,\" like insurance paperwork.\nThe Eakin family has been bouncing from one short-term rental to another.

The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

        "content": "Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence for her role in the 1969 Manson murders, has been recommended for parole for a second time.George Brich/APhide caption\nA panel of the California Board of Parole Hearings has again recommended parole for former Charles Manson follower and convicted killer Patricia Krenwinkel. Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office declined to comment.\nNewsom overturned the board's 2022 parole recommendation,writingthat Krenwinkel still posed \"an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\"\n\"While Ms. Krenwinkel has matured in prison and engaged in commendable rehabilitative efforts, her efforts have not sufficiently reduced her risk for future dangerousness,\" Newsomwrote in his report, saying she had \"not developed sufficient insight into the causative factors of her crime.\"\nKrenwinkel was 21 when she participated in the August 1969 murders of seven people — including actress Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant —at Manson's direction. The cult leader tasked members of his so-called family with the killings in the hopes of inciting an apocalyptic race war, after which he would take control of society.\nOn trial, Krenwinkeladmitted her rolein the Tate-LaBianca murders, which targeted two Los Angeles households over the course of two nights. She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",
