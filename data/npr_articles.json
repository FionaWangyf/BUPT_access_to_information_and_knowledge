Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, rips up a piece of paper that had plans from the Biden administration during a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nDEADHORSE, Alaska — President Donald Trump wants to double the amount of oil coursing through Alaska's vast pipeline system and build a massive natural gas project as its \"big, beautiful twin,\" a top administration official said Monday while touring a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean.\nThe remarks by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright came as he and two other Trump Cabinet members — Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin — visited Prudhoe Bay as part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state that drew criticism from environmentalists.\nDuring the trip, Burgum's agency announced plans to repealBiden-era restrictionson future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.\nThe petroleum reserve is west of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, the industrial encampment near the starting point of the trans-Alaska pipeline system. The pipeline, which runs for 800 miles (nearly 1,300 kilometers), has been Alaska's economic lifeline for nearly 50 years.\nGovernment and industry representatives from several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines, were joining a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on the gas project proposal, which in its current iteration would provide gas to Alaska residents and ship liquefied natural gas overseas. Matsuo Takehiko, vice minister for International Affairs at Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, was among those at Prudhoe Bay on Monday.\nFor years, state leaders have dreamed of such a project but cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition and questions about economic feasibility have hindered progress. U.S. tariff talks with Asian countries have been seen as possible leverage for the Trump administration to secure investments in the proposed gas project.\nOil and natural gas are in significant demand worldwide, Wright told a group of officials and pipeline employees in safety hats and vests who gathered near the oil pipeline on a blustery day with 13-degree Fahrenheit (-10 Celsius) windchills. The pipeline stretched out over the snow-covered landscape.\n\"You have the big two right here,\" he said. \"Let's double oil production, build the big, beautiful twin, and we will help energize the world and we will strengthen our country and strengthen our families.\"\nOil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline peaked at about 2 million barrels in the late 1980s. In 2011 — a year in which an average of about 583,000 barrels of oil a day flowed through the pipeline, then-Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican, set a goal of boosting that number to 1 million barrels a day within a decade. It's never come close in the years since: last year, throughput averaged about 465,000 barrels a day.\nThose joining the Trump officials Monday included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik.\nMatsuo Takehiko, center, Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, speaks to members of the media before a news conference at the Pump Station 1 on Monday, June 2, 2025, located near Deadhorse, Alaska, on the state's prodigious North Slope.Jenny Kane/APhide caption\nIn Utqiagvik, an Arctic community that experiences 24 hours of daylight this time of year, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.\nAlaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Dunleavy and Alaska's senior U.S. senator, Lisa Murkowski, often complained that Biden's team was too restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.\nMurkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for Sunday's meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \"want to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\"\nEnvironmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas and decried Interior's plans as wrong-headed.\nErik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, called the Trump administration's intense focus on oil and gas troubling, particularly in a state experiencing the real-time impacts of climate change. He called the continued pursuit of fossil fuel development \"very frustrating and heartbreaking to see.\"\nThe Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.\nThe three Trump officials also plan to speak at Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

        "content": "United Airline planes are seen at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on May 7.Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nA runway at Newark Liberty International Airport that had been undergoing renovations for weeks and whose closure contributed to a recent wave offlight delays and cancellationshas reopened nearly two weeksahead of schedule.\nOfficials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction.\nSpeaking at a press conference at the airport Monday afternoon, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy heaped praise on Port Authority of New York and New Jersey officials, unions and workers for completing the estimated 60-day project 13 days early.\n\"I think you were going to beat the timeframe by a couple days, but when they saw some of the issues that were happening here at Newark, they actually ramped it up even more,\" Duffy said.\nThe problems at Newark recently came to a head when air traffic controllers directing planes to and from the airportexperienced major technical problems, including the loss of radar and communication abilities. In one case, air traffic controllers took time off to deal with the trauma they experienced as a result of the brief communications blackout. The Federal Aviation Administration says it is also contending with low staffing levels at the Philadelphia TRACON, the radar center that handles flight traffic around Newark.\nOn top of that, Newark'sbusiest runwayfor departing flights closed for renovations in mid-April.\nThe temporary closure of 4L-22R left only two other runways in operation at Newark. On May 20, the Federal Aviation Administrationset a targeted limitof 28 flight arrivals and 28 departures per hour (a 15% reduction) until work on the runway was finished.\nThe Port Authority, which operates Newark's airport, said the confluence of problems facing the airport this spring prompted officials to accelerate the runway construction schedule. Officials hired additional crews so work could continue around the clock and coordinated with contractors to accelerate their timelines, even bringing a second asphalt plant online to speed up production.\n\"It was no easy feat to get here,\" said Port Authority aviation director Sarah McKeon. \"It took around-the-clock work — literally seven days a week of people, multiple crews, paving, milling, electricians, and Port Authority aviation, operations, maintenance and engineering staff to make this happen.\"\nAirport officials said construction on the runway was necessary to ensure it met FAA safety standards. It was last rehabilitated in 2014.\nEleven thousand feet long and 150 feet wide,the runwaywas milled and paved and outfitted with updated lightning and airfield signs. Workers also installed new underground electrical infrastructure and improved the runway's drainage system.\nFAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well. That process, which could take about a week, would allow the airport to increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour.\nThe runway was previously scheduled to reopen on June 15. Though the runway is now open for use, the Port Authority said that to fully complete the project by the end of the year, it would still close the runway on some weeknights and weekends in the coming months.",

        "content": "Rebecca González-Ramos runs Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office — known as Homeland Security Investigations — in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her mandate under President Trump, she said, is to find every deportable immigrant in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Adrian Florido/NPRhide caption\nNo one knows exactly how many immigrants are living without legal status in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Rebecca González-Ramos, ICE's top investigator on the island, estimates it's about 20,000, and since January it's been her job to track down and deport every last one of them.\n\"Our mandate,\" she said, \"is 100 percent. So everybody that's in the United States, and in this case in Puerto Rico, without an immigration status, needs to be removed or deported.\"\nGonzález is the Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. HSI is Immigration and Customs Enforcement's intelligence office – one of dozens of HSI offices nationwide. She is the first woman to lead her office, responsible for investigating customs fraud, drug and weapons smuggling, and human trafficking. But since she assumed the role a few days after Donald Trump's return to the White House, her agents' number one priority has become finding immigrants to deport.\nThey've adopted more aggressive strategies than in past administrations. They're expanding surprise raids at hotels and construction sites, knocking on the doors of people with deportation orders, and questioning others on the street. She saysthey've asked Puerto Rico's department of motor vehicles to hand over the names and addresses of the roughly 6,000 people who got licenses under animmigrant-friendly lawthat extended driving privileges to people without legal status. They take informant tips from everyday citizens calling in to report on their neighbors.\nGonzález-Ramos sat down for an interview with NPR in her San Juan office last week. She said to date ICE agents in Puerto Rico have arrested close to 500 immigrants for deportation in the four months since Trump returned to power. Fewer than 80 had criminal records, and among those who did, the single charge most had faced was for re-entering the United States after a prior deportation. Three-quarters of those arrested have been Dominican nationals. Dominicans have immigrated to Puerto Rico for decades, becoming part of the fabric of society as construction workers, domestic helpers, cooks, lawyers, professors, teachers and police officers. Recent raids have sent terror coursing through Dominican neighborhoods.\nGonzález-Ramos's operations on the island offer a glimpse into how ICE offices nationwide are ramping up their surveillance, investigation and enforcement tactics to deliver on President Trump's mass deportation promises.\nThe interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:\nNPR: Now that your mandate is to deport 100 percent of people here without status, do you have quotas?\nGonzález-Ramos:No, we don't have quotas. We just have a mandate to execute our authorities and use our resources to enforce immigration.\nNPR: I want to talk about how you find people. What have you told your agents to do differently? What are they allowed to do now that they weren't allowed to do in the past?\nGonzález-Ramos:Their authority has always been the same. We work a lot with intelligence and information received. We have a communication center here. We receive a lot of calls from individuals saying, hey, my neighbor that's present here illegally, or my ex-wife, you know. Those leads are worked by the intel group. We help identify the addresses of those individuals that already have final deportation orders. We're the investigative arm, we work on leads, we develop sources, we develop different information that comes, trying to first make sure that the information is good. We're not going to move forward on something just because it came in. What I've told my agents is that they need to make sure that they do everything by the law and treat everybody with dignity.\nNPR: Do they need warrants? Either judicial arrest warrants or administrative warrants? (An arrest warrant is issued by a judge. An administrative warrant, which carries less legal weight, is signed by an ICE official directing an agent to detain someone)\nGonzález-Ramos:Arrest warrants sometimes are necessary because, for example, we had an individual we had identified and he was inside his house and he didn't want to come out. So we had to get an arrest warrant.\nNPR: What about when your agents are going into a neighborhood and there's a group of men and women on a street corner. Are you telling them it's okay to use their suspicion that someone might be in the country illegally to detain them now and ask questions later?\nGonzález-Ramos:The way it works is if there's a group of people on a corner, the officers will go and then we'll ask them questions to determine alienage. And they'll say, \"Yes, I'm a legal permanent resident,\" and we'll say, \"Let me see your ID.\" And some of them have it with them. Some of them don't. I think now, these days, they all have it with them. And based on those answers is when we decide if we're going to detain them or not.\nNPR: It becomes very subjective. Agents going out and deciding who to question or to detain. I've spoken with a couple of Dominicans (with legal status) who've been detained and then released. Why is that happening?\nGonzález-Ramos:It's going to depend on the situation we're in. The most important thing is our officers' safety. So, if I'm in a place where there's a lot of people surrounding us and it's a big operation, I cannot let you go and find your Legal Permanent Resident card. Because I don't know where you're going to go. I don't know if you're going to go to a car. I don't know what you have inside that car. That's why it's so important for them to have their identification with them. Anybody who has residency, they need to have that card with them. Even on the card, it says by law, when you're a legal permanent resident, you need to have your ID with you at all times.\nNPR: What about a citizen?\nGonzález-Ramos:I've never detained a citizen here. If it's a citizen, it's a citizen.\nNPR: What is the agent using to decide whether enough suspicion exists to detain someone?\nGonzález-Ramos:The agent can justify his acts by different means. Reasonable suspicion. They had identified an individual that didn't have status right next to them. But those persons are not being detained. A person is being asked questions about their nationality. When you're detained is when I put the cuffs on and I put you in the van and I transport you to the facility to process you. And if you tell me you do have status, those are the first individuals that we're going to make sure that we check in the system so we can release them. We don't want to detain anyone that has a legal status in the U.S.\nNPR: But you're acknowledging that you are doing that, because if they've made it to the facility, you're checking them out there, not in the street.\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah. I have to transport you because you don't have your documents with you. There's no other way for me to determine that unless I check the system and I run your fingerprints.\nNPR: I've been speaking with people in the Dominican community who say they feel they're being targeted because they're Black and because they have Dominican accents.\nGonzález-Ramos:I don't agree with that at all. That would be very irresponsible of us to intervene with individuals just because they have a Dominican accent. I want to say maybe 80 percent of the agents that I have are from Puerto Rico. So they know that a large number of our Dominican population are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The majority are not here without status. There's been people detained from all sorts of countries. It's not just Dominicans. Most of them have been Dominicans because they are the highest population here from a foreign country (About 60 percentof Puerto Rico's foreign-born population is Dominican).\nNPR: Are your agents as likely to question on the street a white person with a Puerto Rican accent?\nGonzález-Ramos:If we are looking for an individual with a final order of deportation in a group of four, all four are going to be asked the questions. It doesn't matter if you have blue eyes and blonde hair, or if you have a Puerto Rican accent. Here in Puerto Rico, we're of all colors. Moving on accents and moving on people's color, first of all, it's illegal. And second of all, it's not the way HSI does business. We work based on intelligence and executing either arrest warrants or final orders of deportation. And everybody in that group is going to be asked, no matter how they look or how they sound.\nNPR: The driver's licenses (that Puerto Rico has given to about 6,000 immigrants without legal status). Did you request that list?\nGonzález-Ramos:The Puerto Rico government is cooperating with us in anything that we ask them for. And we're asking for that in order to move forward with the mission. And we're waiting.\nNPR asked a spokeswoman for Puerto Rico's governor about this on Monday afternoon. She acknowledged receipt of the request. NPR will update the story if we receive an additional response.\nNPR: Your operation at La Concha Hotel in early May (in which 53 Dominican construction workers were arrested) -- how did you decide to go there that morning?\nGonzález-Ramos:There was intelligence. And we moved forward with it. As part of all of our business inspections, we get a lot of intelligence from competitors, people that, you know, might have bid for that same contract and know that the individual that actually won the bid can do it because he's paying his workers less. A lot of revenge. I'm not saying that's what happened here. That's just an example.\nNPR: These revenge tips – are you getting a lot of people now reporting people they don't like?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, we didn't used to get that. Now, I want to say we get around 10 to 12 calls a day in our communications center, and maybe five of those are immigration related. There's always somebody that it's like, there's a neighbor that they don't get along with, or an ex-husband, ex-wife, ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.\nNPR: And your agents will go check it out?\nGonzález-Ramos:Yeah, it's added to the leads. And if it's a valid lead, we'll move forward on it. Everything that comes through the tip line in regards to immigration, it's going to be a priority.\nNPR: Do you recognize the fear, the terror, that the people and communities that you're targeting for deportation feel?\nGonzález-Ramos:I can definitely see where they can be concerned and worried. It's a change in somebody's life. But I don't see a reason for them to be scared or live in fear, because the message is very simple. If you do not have a status in the United States, you have to leave. They're not going to be mistreated. They have mechanisms to leave on their own. I see how they can be concerned. But afraid? Or to live in fear? I don't see a reason for that.",

        "content": "President Trump speaks during a news conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Trump administration has releasednew detailsof its vision to wind down the U.S. Department of Education. The budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 15% funding cut to the department and a handful of changes to key K-12 and higher education programs. Here are five things to know:\nLast month, afederal judge blockedTrump from carrying out his executive order calling for the education secretary to close the Education Department. Nonetheless, the proposed budget summary begins with a quote from Trump on the day he signed that executive action: \"We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs.\"\nOverall, the proposal \"reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down,\" the document says.\nStill, this summary requests $66.7 billion for the department, making it clear that the dismantling of the agency will be a marathon, not a sprint.\nTitle I, one of the two most important streams of federal funding to K-12 schools, provides extra help to districts that serve neighborhoods of concentrated poverty.\nPublic school advocates have fretted that the administration's ultimate goal is to disrupt or even wind down this funding, as called for in the conservative policy playbook Project 2025. But this budget request would leave Title I funding levels where they've been the previous two years: just over $18 billion.\nIn addition to administering those important Title I dollars, the Education Department also sends districts roughly $6.5 billion to administer 18 smaller programs that support, among other things, teacher training, at-risk students, literacy instruction, rural schools, arts education, school safety and students experiencing homelessness. This budget summary recommends combining them all into one grant and dramatically cutting funding to $2 billion.\nThis consolidation would, in the administration's view, give districts \"flexibility\" to spend the dollars \"consistent with the needs of their communities.\" But it would also eliminate individual funding streams for programs.\nFor example,advocates told NPRthey worry that if support for students experiencing homelessness isn't specifically funded, districts may choose to spend those federal dollars on other students and other needs.\nIn a statement, The School Superintendents Association (AASA) applauded the administration's decision to preserve Title I funding levels but criticized the decision to release a budget summary that \"eliminated other crucial education funding, under the guise of efficiency.\"\nBesides Title I funding to high-poverty school communities, the other key federal funding stream to schools comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires all public schools to provide a free, appropriate education to all children with disabilities.\nThe Trump administration proposes what appears to be an increase in IDEA funding to states, to roughly $14.9 billion, but the budget summary also suggests folding several previously separate programs into that funding stream. Once those costs are accounted for, districts' special education funding would be essentially flat.\nOn the higher education side, the budget summary proposes a few significant changes to the federal role in helping students pay for college.\nFederal Pell Grants go to low-income students and do not need to be paid back; the administration wants to cut the maximum amount of the annual grant from roughly $7,400 to $5,700. That would be a significant reduction, considering the average, all-in cost to attend a public, four-year university in 2022-23 wasmore than $22,000.\nThis cut to Pell, along with other proposed cuts, \"reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,\" said Melanie Storey, the president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA),in a statement.\nThe budget summary attributes this change to a growing shortfall in Pell funding and insists that \"maintaining the current maximum award and eligibility would put the program in an untenable financial position.\"\nThe administration also proposes a dramatic flip in the Federal Work-Study program, slashing funding by roughly 80% and calling on colleges and universities to take on the bulk of students' hourly wages.",

Since the start of the administration, mayors and governors of cities seen as \"sanctuary\" have been called to testify in Congress and federal agencies have looked into curbing federal resources from these areas.\nIn practice, sanctuary jurisdictions prohibit local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration officials on immigration-related operations.\nBut the list quickly faced intense criticism from mayors and law enforcement confused as to why they had been included. Over the weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association President Sheriff Kieran Donahueaccused DHS of lacking transparencyand accountability in how the list was compiled.\n\"This list was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation. Sheriffs nationwide have no way to know what they must do or not do to avoid this arbitrary label,\" Donahue said, calling on DHS to remove the list. \"This decision by DHS could create a vacuum of trust that may take years to overcome.\"\nLocal leaders across the country also raised issues with their inclusion on the list. Mayors fromBoise, Idaho,andSan Diego, for example, were surprised to see their cities named. Colorado leaders also raised concerns; Aurora wasremoved before the list was posted.\nPresident Trump issued anexecutive order on April 28that directed the department and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions \"obstructing federal immigration law enforcement and notify each sanctuary jurisdiction of its non-compliance, providing an opportunity to correct it.\"\n\"Some of the cities have pushed back. They think that because they don't have one law or another on the books that they don't qualify but they do qualify,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem onFox'sSunday Morning Futures.\nThe list, a senior DHS official said in a statement to NPR, is constantly reviewed, can be changed at any time and will be \"regularly\" updated.\n\"Designation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\" the official's statement said.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken steps to retaliate against jurisdictions it considered \"sanctuary.\" For example, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ended coordination on naturalization ceremonies with \"sanctuary cities that restrict the ability of law enforcement to cooperate with DHS – in defiance of the rule of law – to enforce immigration laws and keep American communities safe from illegal and violent aliens,\" according to USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser.\nThe administration has vowed toreview federal disaster aid and other assistancethat goes to \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The withholding of funding prompted lawsuits from 16 jurisdictions. Ajudge blocked the move.\nThe administration has also takencities to court over policiesit says limit cooperation with immigration authorities.",

Krenwinkel was found suitable for parole for the second time in three yearson Friday.\nBut it'snot a done deal: The board's legal division has up to 120 days to finalize the decision, at which point the governor has 30 days to review and potentially reverse it.

She confessed to chasing 25-year-old coffee heiress Abigail Folger with a knife and stabbing her 28 times at Tate's house on Cielo Drive, then helping kill grocery store executive Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night.\nKrenwinkel said she stabbed Leno LaBianca with a fork and used the couple's blood to scrawl \"death to pigs\" on the wall.\nKrenwinkel was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder and — alongside Manson and several other cult members — sentenced to death in 1971. The following year, after Californiabriefly outlawedthe death penalty, their sentences were commuted to life with the possibility of parole.\nKrenwinkel has been denied parole14 timessince then. Now 77, she is the longest-serving woman in California prison.\nKeith Wattley, Krenwinkel's parole attorney, said in a statement shared with NPR that \"no matter how serious and disturbing the facts of the crime, if a person gets a parole-eligible sentence, our laws require that they be released once they are no longer dangerous.\"\n\"After 56 ½ years of incarceration with no rule violations, with substantial change in who she is, and with the last nine psychological evaluators over the past 40 years agreeing that Pat is no longer a risk, it's time to make the possibility of parole a reality,\" he added, calling on Newsom to support the recommendation.\nMansondied in 2017while serving nine life sentences. One of his followers,Susan Atkins, died of brain cancer in prison in 2009. Another, Leslie Van Houten,walked free in July 2023after spending over five decades in custody.\nThe state parole board had recommended Van Houten for parole five times starting in 2016, but Newsom and his predecessor both reversed those decisions, most recently in 2022. Later that year, a state appeals court separately granted Van Houten's petition for writ of habeas corpus, and Newsomdeclined to challengethe case — paving the way for her eventual freedom.\nFrom left: Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, laugh as they walk to court in Los Angeles for sentencing on March 29, 1971.Anonymous/AP/APhide caption\nKrenwinkel has said that her complicated family dynamics and low sense of self-esteem made her vulnerable to Manson's manipulation.\n\"It is countless how many lives were shattered by the path of destruction that I was a part of, and it all comes from just a simple thing as just wanting to be loved,\" shetold theNew York Timesin 2014.\nIn her late teens, Krenwinkel lost contact with friends, dropped out of school and moved in with her sister in Manhattan Beach, Calif., where she met and becameenamored with Manson. She joined his \"family,\" touring the American West for 18 months together before settling at the infamous Spahn Ranch in 1969.\nShe said at her2022 parole hearingthat Manson was initially affectionate towards her but became increasingly controlling and abusive. Over time, the group became more isolated, and violence was normalized — she and other members were trained in using weapons, for example.\n\"I had just totally allowed myself to just start absolutely becoming devoid of any form of morality or real ethics,\" she told parole officials.\nKrenwinkel said by the time she was sitting in isolation on death row, in her early 20s, she made the decision to take responsibility for her past actions and decisions going forward.\nDuring herdecades in prison, she earned a bachelor's degree and participated in numerous self-help and community service programs, including supporting incarcerated people with severe mental illness and training dogs to become service animals for people with disabilities. Newsom said she had never been disciplined while in prison and was only cited twice for minor infractions, most recently in 2005.\nKrenwinkel told the 2022 hearing that she'd spent the last 50 years working with mental health professionals, \"trying to locate that bottom that absolutely allowed me to feel nothing and be nothing and see myself as nothing.\" As a result, she said, she now enjoys her own company and feels comfortable acting on her wants and needs.\n\"It's important to me that … not become internal again, that I let people know who I am,\" she said. \"Whether or not you accept me, I don't care. This is your life. And I am content with what I have done to try and put the pieces back together.\"\nPatricia Krenwinkel, pictured at a 2011 parole hearing at the California Institution for Women in Corona, Calif. She has been denied parole 14 times since the 1970s.Reed Saxon/APhide caption\nIn parole hearings over the years, Krenwinkel has accepted responsibility for her crimes and blamed Manson — and the toxic dynamics of their relationship — for coercing her into them.\nThat wasn't evidence enough for Newsom, who wrote in 2022 that she had not adequately reflected on \"her own internal processes\" that led her to join and support Manson's \"terror campaign.\"\n\"Ms. Krenwinkel was not only a victim of Mr. Manson's abuse. She was also a significant contributor to the violence and tragedy that became the Manson Family's legacy,\" he wrote. \"Beyond the brutal murders she committed, she played a leadership role in the cult, and an enforcer of Mr. Manson's tyranny.\"\nNewsom said the crimes Krenwinkel committed were \"among the most fear-inducing in California's history,\" saying that would present significant stressors and public safety challenges if she were granted parole. Krenwinkel has said she would change her name if released, but would still want to be involved in the community.\n\"I would like to become engaged with what's going on in the world but I do know that I would be very — I would listen very carefully and try to make myself aware of who I am around,\" she said at the 2022 hearing. \"And … if there's something that could turn into something that would be negative, I would have to be aware of that at all times, that I do know.\"\nTheNew York Timesreportsthat Krenwinkel did not speak at her four-hour parole hearing on Friday, though family members of her victims read statements of opposition. Debra Tate, Sharon's sister, created an online petition asking Newsom to reverse her parole. It has over 116,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\"For years this woman laughed about the murders in court and showed absolutely no remorse at all,\" Tate wrote, adding, \"Society cannot allow this serial killer who committed such horrible, gruesome, random killings back out.\"",

The idea sprung from his work in Houston the year prior with kids displaced byHurricane Harvey. He said camp counselors are uniquely equipped to care for children in the wake of natural disasters. The camp's approach, Latner said, is rooted in research showing thatadverse childhood experiencesare linked to lifelong physical and mental health problems.\n\"By providing that sense of safety and normalcy at camp, we can help to lower their stress levels, return them to a routine, and only then can they start to create a narrative around what has happened … so that they understand that something has happened and that they're safe now — to end that uncertainty and fear,\" Latner said.\nProject:Camp founder Mikey Latner talks to a camper.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nCampers do handstands on the soccer field at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nWith its first camp up and running three days after the Palisades fire ignited on Jan. 7, Project:Camp ended up putting ona total of 10 camps throughout the region, welcoming 5- to 16-year-olds. Many of the camps lasted for two or three weeks.\nThe program offered typical day camp activities such as arts and crafts, and games like tag.

Since the fires, she said, parents have reached out to her seeking therapy for their kids after noticing signs of emotional and physical distress tied to the tragedy. Some kids are experiencing an increase in panic or nightmares, are more prone to separation anxiety and mood swings, while others appear unaffected, according to O'Malley.\n\"Their sense of safety, stability — that was all rocked,\" she said.\nFor kids who experience a natural disaster, O'Malley said, it helps to find some sense of normalcy to begin the healing process.\nEmory Stumme enjoys lunch with her camp group at Project:Camp in Glendale, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nBecca said Emory's time at the camp gave her daughter a chance to connect with friends while her school was paused.\n\"The first day that we picked her up from camp, I was like, 'Oh this is the old kid again,' \" Stumme said. \"She was able to see her friends and be outside and play and just be a kid and not have to worry about, like, 'Where are we staying tonight?' or 'What clothes do I have?' \"\nThe Eakin family in their temporary home in El Sereno, Calif.Morgan Lieberman for NPRhide caption\nMarah Eakin said sending her 6-year-old twins to the camp gave her some much-needed space to process her own feelings and handle \"grown-up stuff,\" like insurance paperwork.\nThe Eakin family has been bouncing from one short-term rental to another.

A lot in Pacific Palisades, Calif., has yet to be cleared.Liz Baker/NPRhide caption\nLOS ANGELES — Diana Lieb was already on the fence about rebuilding after the Eaton Fire swept through her Altadena, Calif., neighborhood and burned down her house on January 7.\nThere were the still-unresolved insurance claims and economic uncertainty: could she even afford to rebuild? There was also the lingering trauma of going back: her twin daughters' school was also destroyed.\nBut when she heard there could still be toxins in the soils even after federal clean-up crews removed all the debris from her lot, it was the last straw.\n\"It would mean rebuilding a home where my kids are gonna grow up, obviously I don't want them to be on land that is toxic,\" Lieb says. \"There has not been much communication about what is healthy to be around.\"\nLieb and her husband bought in Altadena nine years ago because it was one of the last affordable places in greater-Los Angeles. Their home was originally built in 1926.\nIn April in a widely circulatedreport, Los Angeles County health officials found more than a quarter of properties in the Eaton Fire scraped by federal crews still had toxins above California standards.\nLieb decided to list her lot on the market a few days ago. For now, she and her family will continue to live with her parents in West LA.\nShe says they'll stay there until they can find a condo near her daughters' new school.\n\"It's just been so much upheaval. I want peace,\" she says.\nLA is approaching the five-month mark since January's wildfires killed 30 people and destroyed more than 16,000 structures, many of them homes. Combined, the Eaton and Palisades fires were among the most destructive fires in California history with an estimated$95 to $164 billion in total capital and property losses,according to UCLA's Anderson School of Management.\nInitially, federal disaster officials said it could take up to 18 months to clear all the debris. Anexecutive order signed by President Trumpin late January ordered a fast-tracking of debris removal. And today the clean-up is months ahead of schedule, with predictions that the entire project could be done as early as this July, according to FEMA. There's political and public pressure to make it easier for fire survivors to rebuild. But a growing number of disaster recovery experts and scientists are questioning whether it's safe.\n\"How do we know that soil is safe?\" says Andrew Whelton, an engineering professor at Purdue University. \"Once a disaster like this happens, a number of things we never thought imaginable show up in our lives.\"\nAndrew Whelton stands on a street in Altadena, CA where federal clean-up crews have recently cleared the way for rebuilding.Kirk Siegler/NPRhide caption\nWhelton is nationally known for exposing unexpected hazards that crop up after disasters. His work specifically focused on the removal of toxic chemicals from drinking water.\nIn 2018, his team discovered the water supply in the California town of Paradise was compromised in the aftermath of the deadly Camp Fire. Lately, he's been in LA pushing for comprehensive testing of soils after the lots in the wildfire zone are cleared, something FEMA is no longer required to do nationally.\n\"It's unclear to me why this is different but it clearly is and this is a problem towards a safe and rapid rebuilding,\" he says.\nOn a street in Altadena, residential lots that were recently cleaned up and graded display U.S. Army Corps signs, which indicate it's ok to start building . But Whelton says after destructive fires, there are often lingering toxins from exploded propane tanks or burned cars and high levels of lead from home exteriors after the debris is removed.\n\"They used to be bound up in paint and now they're released into the soil and the question is should we let our kids play in that soil,\" Whelton asks. \"How do we know that soil is safe? The only way to do that is by testing.\"\nFEMA did not respond to NPR's interview request. But in a brief emailed statement, a FEMA spokesperson who was not authorized to speak publicly said research on previous fires showed it was sufficient to remove 3 inches of topsoil to address residual contamination. The statement went on to say that as a result, FEMA had decided to remove 6 inches of soil \"in the interest of public safety.\"\nThe agency has told othernews outletsthat the 6-inch rule has replaced more in-depth soil testing unless there's an immediate hazard.\nWhelton disagrees. He says it's standard protocol to test soils as part of the debris removal process. He notes that sampling was carried out in the aftermath of the Camp Fire, the 2021 Marshall Fire in suburban Colorado and the 2023 blazes on Maui. Members of California's congressional delegation joined Gov. Gavin Newsomin appealingFEMA's decision but so far the agency hasn't budged on its decision not to conduct further testing.\nLast week, LA County approved a plan to pay for soil testing in the footprint of the Eaton Fire. And in the Pacific Palisades, LA Mayor Karen Bass says the city is looking for private groups to step in and pay for testing the federal government isn't conducting. Bass has faced criticism and even calls to resign over her handling of the fires. In an interview with NPR last month, the mayor said the city is working to ensure that people build back fast but also safer.\n\"Speed cannot mean that rebuilding would be done in a sloppy manner or that we would skip steps,\" Bass said.\nFlowers have come up on a lot burned by the Eaton Fire east of Los Angeles.Kirk Siegler/NPRhide caption\nBut no matter how many steps leaders say they'll take, it's too late for many survivors who are giving up and making plans to leave the neighborhoods they once called home.\n\"Every time that they're cleaning up there, they're kicking all of that stuff back up into the air as well,\" says Kwynn Perry, whose rental home burned in Altadena.\nPerry and her husband, an elementary school principal, recently got their teenage son into a new school in another part of the city and found a new condo to rent at close to double the price they were paying in Altadena.\nThey didn't have insurance at the time of the Eaton Fire and now have to pay out of pocket to replace nearly all their belongings.\n\"Even though we're in a better place, we still feel like we're treading water every day,\" Perry says.",

A thick layer of mud covers the area.\nKim Maisch points to a section of the motel that shifted and landed in the river. \"We are actually standing in the middle of where a foundation was for one of the hotel sections,\" she says. \"We are looking at rooms shifted off, cars open, mud, debris everywhere, insulation hanging from the ceilings. Room 222 was my dad's room.\"\nKim Maisch stands in front of the room at the Super 8 Motel where her father was living in September 2024.  Flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Helene shifted many of the buildings in the motel complex completely off their foundations.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nLast September, whenTropical Storm Helene hit western North Carolina, heavy rains forced rivers and tributaries out of their banks, causing the worst flooding seen in more than two centuries. The Swannanoa River swamped much of the town.\nMaisch, 36, lives not far from the motel. She was up most of the night, watching the river rise and worrying about her father.\n\"I called him that morning and woke him up and asked him if he was okay,\" says Maisch. \"He didn't know exactly what was going on. He just knew that they were measuring and keeping an eye on the water. He stood [up] and there was water in his room. His trash can floated right by him, and that's when he had the National Guard knocking on his door.\"\nEveryone got out of the motel safely. Her father has since found another place to live. But most of the others living there still haven't.\nMaisch, who used to clean Airbnb's before Helene, is now working withSwannanoa Communities Together. Local residents formed the group after the storm to focus on the area's greatest need — finding an affordable place to live. She's been helping residents put their lives back together with the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and private aid groups. But it's slow.\n\"I still see heartbreak and I do see a little bit of hope and not the hope that I would have thought during this whole process. It's still one day at a time, one breath at a time,\" Maisch says.\nMaisch's home sits on higher ground across from the Super 8 Motel and sustained damage. \"We have to have our roof replaced,\" but she says she's not complaining. \"I still say minor damage compared to what's around us right now.\"\nEight months after the storm, evidence of Helene's destruction is everywhere in Swannanoa, Black Mountain, Asheville, and other communities throughout western North Carolina. In some places, it's as if the storm came through just last week. Buildings sit damaged, often tilted and off their foundations. Downed trees and piles of debris still wait to be cleared.\nDebris from an automotive shop destroyed by Tropical Storm Helene still waits to be collected nearly eight months after the storm shuttered many businesses in the area.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nBut for many people, the most pressing problem remains finding an affordable place to live. In Asheville, even before the storm, Jen Hampton says there was a housing shortage.\n\"Pre-Helene, we had a vacancy rate on rentals at like 1.2%. So 98.8% of our housing rental units were occupied.\"\nHampton is the housing and wages organizer forJust Economics, a non-profit that advocates for government policies that help address wage and housing issues. With its beauty and moderate climate, North Carolina is one of thenation's fastest growing states. In the 20 years Hampton has lived there, she's seen the community blossom into a major destination for visitors, retirees and remote workers. It raised the demand for housing and its cost dramatically.\n\"We have quite a few illegal Airbnb's operating within city limits. And paired with that, we also have the highest cost of living in the state and also some of the lowest average wages,\" says Hampton. She speaks from first-hand experience. For many years, she lived in public housing while working in the service industry as a bartender, server and line cook at a restaurant struggling with low wages.\nJen Hampton, a housing and wages organizer for Just Economics, sits at a picnic table outside her office in Asheville.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nHelene's flooding and high windsdamaged or destroyed more than 100,000 homes, wiping out whole communities in western North Carolina. Many people struggled to find even temporary housing.\nIt also wrecked Asheville's tourism and service-based economy. \"There's still a lot of people out of work, and unemployment [benefits] stopped,\" she says. Even though businesses are reopening, Hampton says, \"we're seeing the wages actually lower than they were before the storm because there's more demand for jobs than there are jobs available.\"\nHousing advocates wanted the state to impose an emergency moratorium on evictions after the storm, but were unsuccessful. As a result,many were forced to leave their homes.\n\"There are a lot of people living in their cars. There's a lot of people about to be evicted or being threatened with eviction\", says Hampton. \"And we can't build more housing fast enough, and we can't build enough affordable housing fast enough.\"\nNow, it's residents stepping up with possible solutions to the housing crisis.\nMosswood Mobile Home Park in the Emma community is one of the largest mobile home parks near Asheville.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nThere are dozens of mobile home communities in Emma, a hilly wooded community west of Asheville. Emma didn't flood during Helene, but it did receive extensive storm damage.\nAndrea Golden says, \"so many trees came down and the wind and the rain.\" Golden is the founder and co-director ofPoder Emma, a nonprofit that focuses on housing and economic development.\nAt the Mosswood mobile home park, Kelvin Bonilla with Poder Emma drives up to a home being repaired and greets the crew of five working on the property. \"Que onda chicos?\" Bonilla says in his native Spanish, \"what's up dudes?\"\nThe crew is replacing the outside deck on an aging mobile home. Since Helene, crews have repaired roofs, cleared downed trees and installed new insulated siding on dozens of mobile homes, Bonilla says.\nA crew working with Poder Emma reconstructs the porch of a mobile home in Mosswood. It was destroyed by fallen trees during Tropical Storm Helene last September.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nThe work is done at no cost to the homeowners. It allows people to stay in their houses and helps keep housing affordable. Poder Emma has a long home repair waiting list. \"The majority of the people we serve is Latino,\" says Bonilla who came to the U.S. from Honduras.\nGolden says the group was created several years ago as developers and national companies began targeting the community's mostly locally-owned mobile home parks. \"We started the organization to protect the affordable housing that exists here.\"\nPoder has helped residents form cooperatives that, in several cases, have been able to buy the land their homes sit on. Golden and her husband Abel Gonzalez, for example, bought the land their mobile home sits on via a cooperative. That allows them to build equity in their homes and create long-term stable communities.\nAndrea Golden, co-director of Poder Emma, and Abel Gonzalez, her husband, have lived in a 1960s mobile home model for more than a decade. \"It's a beautiful home. It's an asset that I will leave to my three children. But I think there is something that is really real about the vulnerability that people face when they purchase their mobile home - you're a homeowner and you rent the land under it, you don't have that long-term security. Ownership of the land is an important conversation,\" she says.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nIn part because of Poder's work, Golden says local officials have begun to revise old views on mobile homes and the people who live in them. \"Local governments were trying to zone us out of mobile homes and mobile home parks for years,\" she says. \"Now, I think with the affordable housing crisis, the conversation has changed some. But I think there's a lot of myths and stereotypes about mobile homes.\"\nIn communities where residents own the land, she says mobile homes can become permanent, long-term housing. But a lot depends on where they're located.\nIn the town of Swannanoa, people drowned in communities near the river that were overwhelmed by Helene's flooding. It's left many former mobile home residents searching for stable, long-term housing.\nBeth Trigg, with Swannanoa Communities Together, says some people went through the winter living in tents and sheds.\n\"To me, those are a symptom of the fact that the housing crisis is ongoing because it doesn't really work for most people to live in a ten-by-ten uninsulated structure,\" she says. \"It's one step up from a tent.\"\nTrigg and other activists working on the housing crisis are thankful to nonprofits and charities who have stepped in to do repairs and, in some cases, provide homes. But they are frustrated that local, state and federal governments are devoting so little attention to long-term housing needs.\n\"Policy tends to center around rebuilding roads and bridges, and small business loans, and many other things that are very important,\" says Trigg with frustration in her voice. \"And housing is kind of an afterthought. And for us, we think housing needs to be the first thing we think about. And then everything else needs to be centered around that.\"\nThat's the case, Trigg says, especially in Swannanoa, one of the communities hardest hit by Helene. \"We experienced housing loss at a scale totally disproportionately to anywhere else in the region.\"\nPaulina Hernandez has lived in Swannanoa for about two decades. Before the storm, she and her husband used their savings to buy and rent out several mobile homes in a small community next to the river, Hourglass Way.\nIt's now an empty lot. \"There were nine mobile homes here. We own seven. And my son living here and my daughter living in the second one,\" says Hernandez. The couple rented out four.\nThe mobile homes were destroyed in the flood. With them went Hernandez and her husband's life savings. She becomes emotional looking at the bare foundations.\n\"Everything is gone, we don't have a house,\" Hernandez says, tears rolling down her cheeks. \"My son and my daughter, everybody is safe.\"\nThat's the positive note Hernandez holds on to. Everyone got out safely, even a neighbor who refused to evacuate, but was later rescued from his rooftop. With the help of Swannanoa Communities Together, Hernandez and her family have found a temporary apartment.\nBut like many after Helene, she and her husband are searching for a long-term housing solution. Her dream? She says, if the landowner agrees, they hope to be back and rebuild their small mobile home community on Hourglass Way.",

Hours later Sunday, law enforcement had made no arrests and was seeking tips from the public in the case.\nA statement from the Catawba County Sheriff's Office said a 58-year-old man, Shawn Patrick Hood, of Lenoir, was killed, the oldest of the victims who ranged in age from as young as 16. It said seven of the injured remained hospitalized late Sunday, though updates on their conditions were not immediately released.

About 17,000 people there were evacuated by Saturday along with 1,300 in Alberta. About 8,000 people in Saskatchewan had been relocated as leaders there warned the number could climb.\nSmoke was worsening air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some U.S. states along the border.\n\"Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour,\" Saskatchewan's Public Safety Agency warned Sunday. \"As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.\"\nSaskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said firefighters, emergency crews and aircraft from other provinces and U.S. states, including Alaska, Oregon and Arizona, were being sent to help fight the blazes.\n\"We are truly grateful, and we stand stronger because of you,\" Moe said in a post on social media.\nHe said ongoing hot, dry weather is allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees are stretched thin.\n\"The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north,\" Moe said at a Saturday news conference.\nIn Manitoba, more than 5,000 of those evacuated are from Flin Flon, located nearly 645 kilometers (400 miles) northwest of the provincial capital of Winnipeg. In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order Saturday for about 600 residents.\nThe fire menacing Flin Flon began a week ago near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service deployed an air tanker to Alberta and said it would send 150 firefighters and equipment to Canada.\nIn some parts of the U.S., air quality reached \"unhealthy\" levels Sunday in North Dakota and small swaths of Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'sAirNowpage.\n\"We should expect at least a couple more rounds of Canadian smoke to come through the U.S. over the next week,\" said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the U.S.\nSeparately, a fire in the U.S. border state of Idaho burned at least 100 acres (40 hectares) as of Sunday, prompting road closures and some evacuations, according to the Idaho Department of Lands. The agency said in a news release that at least one structure was burned, but did not provide additional details about the damage.\nStrong gusty winds of 15 to 20 mph (24 to 32 kph) and steep terrain were making it difficult for firefighters battling the fire, which ignited Saturday.\nEvacuation centers have opened across Manitoba for those fleeing the fires, one as far south as Winkler, 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the U.S. border. Winnipeg opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, business people and convention-goers.\nManitoba's Indigenous leaders said Saturday at a news conference that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees are arriving are full, and they called on the government to direct hotel owners to give evacuees priority.\nAssembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s.\n\"It's really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired,\" Wilson said at a news conference.\nCanada's wildfire season runs from May through September. Its worst-ever wildfire season was in 2023. It choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.",

And this is where we spent the majority of our time right here.\"\nNow, if you look closely, you can see the home foundation covered with mud. The couple lived here for 30 years, next to Mrs. Pacheo's mother, whose house is damaged, but still standing.\n\"This whole property was trees, trees, trees, trees,\" says Mrs. Pacheo looking around her property still in disbelief eight months after the stormhit on September 27. \"And you see, there's just these few left.\"\nAs the Atlantic hurricane season begins, meteorologists are working to improve forecasting and warnings for the hazard that causes the most hurricane deaths: freshwater flooding. Withclimate change, storms are becomingbigger and wetterand are bringing large amounts of rain to inland areas, often with deadly consequences.\nAt least 249 people died during Hurricane Helene and its aftermath, according to theNational Hurricane Center. Of those, 94 fatalities are attributed to rainfall flooding.\nIn September, the Pacheos, who are in their early 60s, knew a big storm was coming, but they weren't too worried. Other tropical systems had flooded their creek before, but water had never come into their home. Jackie had hurt her knee and was on crutches, and had a cat she didn't want to leave. They settled in as Helene's rain came down.\n\"We were asleep, and I got an alarm on my phone,\" recalls Mrs. Pacheo.\nThe message? \"Evacuate now. Get out now,\" she says.\nIt was an emergency alert from Buncombe County sent to people who lived in low areas near rivers and tributaries that were beginning to flood.\n\"We grabbed what we could, and I tried to get my cat, but she wouldn't come with me because there was so much water out here already. So she perished in my house.\" Mrs. Pacheo says.\nStuart and Jackie Pacheo lean out the window where they had to watch their own home carried off by the floodwaters of Tropical Storm Helene. Mrs. Pacheo and her husband escaped the flood at her mother's home, which was right next to their own.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nShe decided to rip off her cast. She and her husband waded through the water to her mother's house next door, which also flooded.\n\"We had water coming from all directions. It looked like a raging ocean,\" says Mrs. Pacheo\nFrom a second-floor window at her mother's house, the couple watched their home, their vehicles, and everything they owned wash away in the flood. They also felt their home crash into her mother's.\n\"It shook the whole house. We thought the whole thing was going to collapse. That's when we called 911,\" Mrs. Pacheo says, \"they told us to hang sheets out the window and somebody would be here to help. And we just sat down and started praying because there wasn't anything else.\"\nThe Pacheos feel torn about staying and rebuilding or moving elsewhere, especially Mrs. Pacheo. \"I've been here for the better part of my life,\" she says. \"And this was my mother and father, and we [have] lived here since I was 11.\" But she says she's tired. \"I'd like to just go away and forget about all of this and not deal with all of it, because it's a lot to deal with.

Dozens of people drowned in Helene's floodwaters.\nThe director of communications for Buncombe County, Lilian Govus, says, \"We all knew that a big storm was coming, but we weren't quite able to grab the attention in the way that we had hoped.\"\nGovus hoped archival photos of the1916 floodpublicized before Helene might help warn people about what was coming. It didn't work. Two days before the storm hit, county officials declared a state of emergency and encouraged people in some communities to evacuate.\n\"I think only one media outlet attended that press conference ahead of the storm,\" recalls Govus. \"And so really trying to get folks' attention to let them know how serious this was, was difficult.\"\nGovus says she knew there was a problem when she couldn't get the message across to her own family.\n\"And I thought, if I can't get this emergency message to stick with my own husband and let him know that he needs to buy more than two gallons of water to get through this, then I knew that I had my work cut out for me and our team.\"\nMany along theRiver Arts District, known as the RAD, a one-mile stretch of artists' studios along the French Broad River in Asheville, did prepare ahead of the storm, says Jeffrey Burroughs, president of the RAD.\nBurroughs says many artists moved their work to a different location and,\"they even went as far as to move things onto the second floor. But who even knew that it didn't even matter?\" Because water reached the second floor in some buildings, says Burroughs, \"It's terrifying.\"\nJeffrey Burroughs stands in front of shelves of jewelry at their storefront in the River Arts District of Asheville, N.C.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nBefore Helene 750 artists worked on the RAD, a unique and vibrant arts district, Burroughs says, \"that's quite marvelous and incredible.\" Currently, Burroughs says, \"we have 350 artists back up and running,\" the Upper River Arts District is open now, but the Lower district, closer to the river, is not yet, says Burroughs.\nThe RAD took a big hit from Helene, with extensive flooding, widespread damage and losses for studios and artists in the district.\n\"The arts in Buncombe County, primarily Asheville, generates about $1-billion a year in sales,\" says Burroughs. \"We are an essential part, an important part of Asheville.\"\nIn the aftermath of the storm, artists and volunteers helped clean up and preserve art found all over the area. Weeks went by with no running water or internet signal, says Burroughs, an imposing 6-feet-plus jewelry designer whose studio was not damaged by the storm.\nSince January, the district has been brainstorming to reimagine what RAD will look like in the future. The goal is to bring back all the artists who lost studios, artwork, equipment and materials to the storm, says Burroughs.\n\"People always say, we're going to come back bigger, we're going to come back stronger. Okay, great. What does that mean?\" that's so esoteric, Burroughs says.\n\"For me, what that means is first, we're building back with creativity at the helm, at the heart, and then we say, okay, how do we create resilience? How do we create flood proofing?\" Burroughs asks. \"How do we create a way that comes back that this never happens again, that another person doesn't have to go through this again? You know, we have artists that lost their entire life's work and there's no way to recreate that.\"\nMars Hill is a rural community about a 20-minute scenic drive from Asheville. Sarah Bivins and her partner Barry Cooper live on Ivy Creek, which on most days meanders pleasantly past their small farm. During the storm, it was a raging torrent.\nSarah Bivins lifts a plastic woven mat from a pile of downed trees and debris that washed onto her farm property during the flooding from Hurricane Helene. \"It's still perfectly good. Just a few holes in it.\"Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nThe couple shows visitors around their farm, which is still mostly covered in river mud with several large piles of lumber and debris. Before the storm, they grew medicinal herbs, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, cucumbers, among other things.\n\"We had hoop houses over there in the garden, but it's underneath this big pile of mud,\" says Bivins. Cooper finishes her sentence, \"and chickens. That's the chicken house there. Unfortunately, all the chickens were in the house and they all drowned.\"\nOnly a few visiting Canada geese remain.\nStanding next to the creek, it's hard to imagine it swelled up to 15 feet. From their house on a hillside, Cooper and Bivins watched as their vehicles and most of their farm washed away. Cooper says the creek has always been the soundtrack at the farm. During the storm, the water and everything it took along the way, became as loud as a roaring train.\nSarah Bivins and Barry Cooper's truck being washed downstream from their farm during the flooding from Hurricane Helene.Photo courtesy of Sarah Bivinshide caption\n\"You could hear the sound of the river picking up and the sound of trees being snapped off at the base by other trees and debris in the middle of the river,\" Cooper recalls. \"They were just being snapped off and so it was a horrible sound.\"\nCooper says he heard the warnings and declaration of a state of emergency prior to the storm, but he didn't think much about it.\n\"Do I want to say that a lot of times I think they sensationalize this sort of news?\" says Cooper. \"In some places, people really are in grave danger. If there wasn't a river here, there'd be nothing to talk about.\"\nBivins and Cooper have lived there for a little more than a decade. They could move somewhere else, \"but this is what we like to do, we are comfortable here,\" Cooper says. They're committed to restoring their land and growing food again.\nBarry Cooper cuts fresh asparagus in front of piles of downed trees and debris cleaned up from the fields and property making up his farm.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\n\"You're connected to thousands of years of wisdom, people learning how to live in cooperation with the land and hopefully improve it,\" he says. Looking out into the distance, Cooper says, \"You are getting that wisdom from your local community. The people that farm or garden are very interesting, very resourceful, very astute.\"\nIn the eight months since the storm, Buncombe County official Lilian Govus has had time to think about why so many people stayed in their homes in low-lying areas.\nGovus says it had been more than a century since the area had seen a flood like that. And people in the mountains pride themselves on being tough and resilient. In North Carolina, Govus says, nearly 80 people died from Helene's flooding, the majority of them in Buncombe County.\n\"And then also, we live in an area where we have nuisance flooding on a regular basis,\" says Govus. \"And so when we were saying rivers were going to crest at 20 feet, 23 feet, it was impossible to even put that into a scenario where people could apply it to their own personal lives.\"\nThe deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, Jamie Rhome, says that's a phenomenon social scientists call \"localization of risk.\"\n\"It's pretty easy, generally speaking, to convince people that something is coming. It's very hard to convince them something's going to happen bad at their house,\" Rhome says.\nTwo days before Helene hit the area, the National Hurricane Center issued an alert warning of \"catastrophic and potentially life-threatening flash and urban flooding\" in western North Carolina. The hurricane center had also begun using a new forecast map, which highlighted in red the risk of flooding posed to the area.\nRhome says there are several reasons why freshwater flooding is now the leading cause of death in hurricanes. Because of climate change, the storms now are carrying more moisture, moving slower and dropping more rain.\n\"And they're moving more inland than they have in the past. And so that's striking parts of the country that might not be as aware of their risk,\" says Rhome.\nIn past decades, storm surge was the largest cause of death from hurricanes. While that's still a major concern, improved forecasting and widespread evacuations from coastal areas in the path of a hurricane have helped reduce those deaths. Rhome says ordering evacuations from inland flooding poses a greater challenge.\n\"For an area like western North Carolina, where do you evacuate them to?\" Rhome asks. \"Because it's very hard to drive out of the flood risk if it's a multi-state risk.\"\nThere were hundreds of landslides in western North Carolina in Helene, which made evacuatingeven more difficultand dangerous.\nMany residents of the areas hit hardest by Tropical Storm Helene, like Swannanoa, N.C., are still living in temporary housing. Some residents have moved into small sheds or trailers after their previous homes were destroyed by the floodwaters or fallen trees.Nickolai Hammar/NPRhide caption\nEight months after the storm, evidence of the damage is everywhere in western North Carolina. Thousands are still out of their homes. People are struggling to find places to live or to fix their damaged houses as another hurricane season gets underway.\nBuncombe County's Lilian Govus says this isn't what people expected.\n\"We were supposed to be a climate refuge. I have friends here who moved from California a few years ago because this was the place to be,\" she says, \"looking at the landscape of where the threats are, climate change is happening so quickly it changes the way that we need to be prepared for every single situation.\"\nGovus says since Helene hit here, she's noticed a new interest in preparedness. She saw that earlier this year when the area was hit by a string of wildfires.\nEven her husband, whom she tried unsuccessfully to motivate before Helene is now on board. He has a propane-heated shower and a system for harvesting rainwater ready for this hurricane season.",

The Pacers defeated the Knicks 4-2 to advance to the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder.Gregory Shamus/Getty Imageshide caption\nOklahoma City Thunder fans have waited for an NBA title since their team arrived in town in 2008. For fans of the Indiana Pacers, who joined the NBA way back in 1976, the wait for a championship has lastednearly 50 years.\nNow, for one team, that drought is about to end. The Thunder and the Pacers will meet in this year's NBA Finals for the chance to finally bring a trophy home.\nBefore moving to Oklahoma City and rebranding as the Thunder, the teamwon a title in 1979as the Seattle SuperSonics. Soon after the team relocated in 2008, the Thunder were contenders and reached the Finals in 2012. But that generation of the team was unable to capitalize on an ultra-talented roster (with Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden), and the Thunder had been unable to return to the Finals — until now, after dispatching the Minnesota Timberwolves 4 games to 1.\nThe Pacers have reached the NBA Finals only once in franchise history, in 2000, when they fell to the back-to-back-to-back Los Angeles Lakers championship squad. Indiana clinched its spot Saturday night after winning a thrilling Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks in six games.\nThe opening game in the best-of-seven Finals will tip off Thursday, June 5.\nThe Thunder have had one of the most dominant seasons in NBA history. At 68-14, Oklahoma City had the best record in the regular season, during which they outscored opponents by 12.9 points per game —an NBA record.\nTheir success this year has come on the strength of their young core trio of superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, wing Jalen Williams and seven-footer Chet Holmgren. Holmgren is 23, Williams is 24 and Gilgeous-Alexander, who was named league MVP after leading the NBA in scoring this season, is only 26.\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder's success this year has come on the strength of their young core trio of superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (right), wing Jalen Williams and seven-footer Chet Holmgren.

In the series-clinching Game 6, the Pacers won 125-108.\n\"Some of the shot-making in this series has been really beyond belief,\" head coach Rick Carlisle said after Indiana's win in Game 4. \"When you can get a stop and a rebound, it almost feels like an anomaly sometimes.\"\nFor Indiana point guard Tyrese Haliburton, these playoffs have been a coming-out party. Just a month ago, an anonymous player poll conducted byThe Athleticnamed Haliburton the league's \"most overrated player.\" During the Eastern Conference Finals, he shined, with a flawless triple-double performance in Game 4 and another 21 points Saturday in Game 6. Forward Pascal Siakam won the Eastern Conference Finals MVP.\nIndiana and Oklahoma City are two of the smallest media markets in the NBA. The Indianapolis metro area is home to about 2.1 million people. Oklahoma City is smaller, with around 1.5 million people in the metro.\nBut the success of the teams has invigorated both cities — especially in Oklahoma, where the Thunder are the only major professional sports team in the entire state.\nNo matter which team wins, this Finals will see the seventh different champion over the past seven years, a remarkable display of parity in the modern NBA.",

Hiram Malone came to Louisiana from Alabama, hospitalized at 21 with a fatal case of pneumonia. Samuel Prince was a 40-year-old cook, who succumbed to tuberculosis.\nThey were among 19 Black patients who died at one New Orleans hospital in the 1870s, and whose heads were removed by a doctor to be sent to Germany. There, the crania werestudied as \"specimens\"in what was then a proliferatingpseudoscience of phrenology. It purported connections between someone's intellect or morality and the size or shape of their skull, with some doctors theorizing superiority of one race over another.\nThe skulls of those 19 patients have now been repatriated to Louisiana after more than a century abroad. On Saturday, they were honored in a multi-faith memorial and laid to rest in a jazz funeral rooted in New Orleans tradition.\n\"We can't be sure exactly where they came from. And so here, we have them. And what are we to make of what happened to them?\" Eva Baham, a historian from Dillard University who led the cultural repatriation committee, saidduring Saturday's service. \"You can be angry. You could be upset, rightly so. But we can't stay there.\"\nThe remainswere returned bythe University of Leipzig, which in 2023 contacted the city archeologist in New Orleans,acknowledgingthe skulls had been acquired in a \"colonial context and unethically.\" The two-year return process involved city, state and academic institutions. It culminated in a notable international restitution, a return of African American remains from Europe — with many remains still lingering in archival collections across the U.S. and abroad,at museumsand universities.\nResearchers presume many of the 19 people had been enslaved, later moved freely after the Civil War, and eventually fell ill or were institutionalized in asylums before landing at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. It was one of the nation's oldest hospitals, serving the city's poor for centuries;it closed due to damagefrom Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Hospital death records helped Baham's team reconstructsome biographical momentsof the 13 men and four women. Two people are unidentified.\nAt Saturday's memorial, a group of Dillard students read from those biographies, ending with their return journey:\n\"Another voyage across the Atlantic, passing bones of enslaved Africans on the ocean floor,\" the students' account went. \"From Africa, to the Caribbean, to the United Sates of America; from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Leipzig, Germany; from Leipzig, Germany to New Orleans, Louisiana — justice carries 19 men and women home. May they walk freely in the city of God, in dignity and in honor.\"\nSaturday's ceremony included prayers from ten religious leaders of different faiths, with an African drum and dance performance leading the attendees out of the chapel. Handlers in white gloves carried memorial vessels containing the skulls for interment. And a jazz band accompanied the procession.\n\"These people's lives had meaning,\" Baham said during the memorial, later adding: \"History is not to wallow in, or wind about. It is to build on. It is to move forward. And when we keep our past hidden, we're starting over every day.\"",

Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, speaks to reporters as she walks to a Senate luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 19, 2024.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption\nIowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst faced intense questioning from her constituents during a Friday town hall, eliciting shouts and boos from community members over her support for President Trump's contentiousOne Big Beautiful Bill Act. One dismissive comment drew particularly intense ire: In response to constituents' concerns over Medicaid cuts, Ernst said, \"We all are going to die.\"\nThe next day, the senator doubled down on her comments in a sarcastic apology video posted to social media. In the video, she appears to be speaking from the grounds of a cemetery.\nHer original remarks came during a town hall in Butler County, Iowa. The first speaker offered Ernst a softball question, telling the National Guard veteran that his sole request was for her to be the guest speaker at the American Legion for Memorial Day next year.\nBut just minutes into thehour-long session, the tenor quickly shifted. The crowd grew tense and Ernst appeared flip and defensive.\nErnst was repeatedly peppered with questions about the thousand-page bill, with many attendees focusing on proposed cuts to safety net programs likeMedicaidandSNAP. Ernst defended the bill, arguing that those eliminated from these programs would be people who were not eligible to benefit from them in the first place.\n\"When you're arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits, 1.4 million (people) … they are not eligible so they will be coming off,\" Ernst said.\nSomeone in the crowd shouted in response: \"People are going to die.\"\n\"Well, we all are going to die,\" Ernst responded. \"For heaven's sakes, folks,\" she continued with a smile.\nThe crowd, which had already grown hostile to Ernst's tone, erupted in roars of disapproval.\nThe GOP budget package is a sweeping piece of legislation that would provide massive tax cuts to the wealthy and slash funding for social programs including Medicaid and food assistance.\nA version of the billnarrowly passedin the House earlier this month — eking by with a final vote of 215-214.\nBut the act faces pushback in the Senate over concerns regarding some of the more consequential aspects of the legislation,which includeextending Trump's 2017 tax cuts — with about $3.8 trillion in cuts overall, largely for the nation's top earners; raising the national debt ceiling by $4 trillion; and costly fees on asylum seekers and those who sponsor unaccompanied minors.\nAs written, the bill is projected to add trillions to the nation's debt over the next decade.\nThe bill is now going through the process ofreconciliation— a complicated Senate process that would allow Republicans to avoid a filibuster by Democratic legislators and pass the bill on a simple majority.\nBack at the Iowa town hall, Ernst continued to spar with voters over her support for these changes.\nIn another heated exchange, a man — who identified himself as a Navy veteran and retired school superintendent — grilled Ernst about Trump's authoritarian style of governing.\n\"Are you afraid of Trump? Are you corrupt like Trump? Or are you just at the point that you don't care anymore and that's why you don't do anything?,\" the man asked to cheers.\nHer response set off another round of dissenting yells.\n\"Obviously I don't agree because I don't think our country is being destroyed,\" she said as the crowd offered shouts in protest.\nAfter the event, Ernst posteda messageto social media, appearing unbothered by the turn of events at the town hall.\n\"Thanks folks for coming out to my town hall in Parkersburg today,\" she wrote. \"I always enjoy hearing from constituents and sharing my work to cut government red tape for you.\"\nThe next day, she appeared to stand firm in her remarks while taking a sarcastic tone in a video shared to her Instagram stories.\nAppearing on camera with what look like tombstones in the background, Ernst said: \"I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall.\"\n\"I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth,\" she continued, adding that she's glad she didn't have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy.\n\"But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my lord and savior, Jesus Christ,\" she said.",

        "content": "U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth delivers an address at the Shangri-La Dialogue Summit in Singapore on Saturday.Mohd Rasfan/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nSINGAPORE — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a starkwarningSaturday about China's threat to the status quo in Asia. He said the U.S. is refocusing its strength and policies on deterring China, and coaxed China's neighbors and U.S. allies to help.\n\"It has to be clear to all that Beijing is credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" Hegseth told civilian and military officials at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's top defense summit.\nThe U.S. does not seek conflict, nor intend to \"dominate or strangle China, to encircle or provoke,\" Hegseth insisted. \"We do not seek regime change.\"\nPrevious U.S. administrations have offered similar reassurances to Beijing. But retired Chinese Senior Col.Zhou Bo, now a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, says he thought Hegseth's speech was \"far more hostile than any of his predecessors made at the Shangri-La Dialogue,\" and were infused with \"ideological rivalry.\"\nZhou adds that Hegseth's Singapore speech was more supportive of U.S. allies than Vice President Vance's starkly criticalremarksat the Munich Security Conference in February. So, Zhou asks, \"which one should we really believe?\"\nHegseth said the U.S. is \"reorienting toward deterring aggression by Communist China.\"\nOne implication of this is that the U.S. couldwithdrawsome of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea to deal with China, including in a case of a potential conflict between mainland China and Taiwan, which the Pentagon calls its \"sole pacing scenario.\" The Pentagon says it has no plans to pull its forces out of South Korea, but insists it must have the \"strategic flexibility\" to put troops where it needs them.\nU.S. interests could diverge from those of South Korea, as the South sees its primary threat coming from North Korea.\n\"I do think we're likely to see a change in force posture on the peninsula. I think the administration has been starting to signal that pretty openly,\" saysZack Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., who was attending the Shangri-La dialogue.\n\"I think the message from the Trump administration,\" he added, \"is that all that matters is what South Korea does on China. And the reality is that U.S.-South Korea interests go far beyond what South Korea does on China.\"\nHegseth's emphasis on U.S. priorities echoed much of President Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric. The defense secretary slammed the Biden administration's policies as \"feckless,\" while praising President Trump's acumen as a dealmaker and efforts to seal its borders to an \"invasion\" of illegal immigrants.\n\"We are not here to pressure other countries to embrace and adopt our politics or ideology,\" Hegseth told the assembled leaders and military officials.\nHegseth conceded that geography makes it necessary for Asian nations to rely on China economically, while seeking defense cooperation with the U.S.\n\"But beware the leverage that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] seeks with that entanglement,\" he warned. \"Economic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defense decision space during times of tension.\"\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his country would remain non-aligned, and against major powers carving out spheres of influence. He said Malaysia would continue to welcome the U.S. presence in the region, but also continue to value it ties with China.\n\"What Southeast Asia needs is a dynamic equilibrium,\" he said, \"that enables cooperation without coercion, and balance without bloc politics.\"\nIn a speech at the forum the evening before Hegseth spoke, French President Emmanuel Macron offered acritiqueof U.S. policies, and encouraged nations to maintain strategic autonomy amid the U.S.-China rivalry.\n\"We want to cooperate. But we don't want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\" he said, apparently alluding to Trump.\nMacron also rejected the double standard of rushing to defend Taiwan — a self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory — while abandoning Ukraine, a move which he said would undermine the U.S.' own credibility.\nChina's embassy in Singapore shot back on itsFacebook pagethat \"comparing the Taiwan question with the Ukraine issue is unacceptable,\" as the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair.\n\"If we use a double standard to look at a double standard,\" it argued, \"we still end up with a double standard.\"\nIn response to Hegseth's remarks, the embassy said ina separate Facebook postthat the U.S. \"claims to safeguard peace and not to seek conflicts. We've heard it. Let's see what moves will it take.\"",

Some,including Hoover, have extensive criminal records involving violenceand gun charges.\n\"There's a lot of mixed messages and mixed signals [from the White House] which creates sort of chaos and uncertainty,\" said Jeffrey Singer, a drug policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank.  \"On the one hand you're threatening even tougher penalties on people who deal in drugs, while on the other hand you're releasing drug dealers from prisons.\"\nRon Safer, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago who helped prosecute members of the Gangster Disciples during the 1990s, said he was shocked and dismayed by Trump's decision to commute Hoover's sentence.\nHe pointed out that Hoover's gang was one of the largest and most violent drug syndicates in the U.S.,operating in 35 states according to the U.S Justice Department. Hoover himself was convicted of state and federal charges including murder and use of a firearm while trafficking drugs.\n\"Larry Hoover was the head of perhaps the most pernicious, efficient drug operation in the United States,\" Safer said. \"They sold over $100 million of drugs a year in the city of Chicago alone. They were responsible for countless murders. They supported their drug territories with ruthless violence.\"\nHoover was first incarcerated in 1973 after being convicted of murder. In the 1990s, he was convicted of federal charges linked to his role directing the Gangster Disciples.\nHoover is now expected to be transferred from a federal supermax prison to a state correctional facility in Illinois, where he'll remain behind bars, for now, because of the state-level murder conviction. Hoover has sought clemency from Illinois officials before, though his latest bid for parole wasrejected overwhelmingly by a state review board in December 2022.\nBut a White House spokesman, commenting on background because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly, told NPR the Trump administration expects Illinois officials to follow the federal government's lead by freeing Hoover.\n\"There have been many advocates saying the time [Hoover] served in prison was adequate,\" the spokesman said.\nTrump's clemency for Hoover and other drug offenders follows a pattern that began during his first term in the White House. While promising tough action against drug dealers,Trump  pardoned or commuted the sentences of at least 13 people convicted of federal drug crimesbetween 2017 and 2021, including high-level dealers linked to violence or convicted of operating major trafficking rings.\nIn 2020,Trump's administration also freed a senior Mexican military officialarrested by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Los Angeles on charges he helped cartels traffic drugs into the U.S. Under pressure from Mexico's government, officials in Trump's Justice Department dropped prosecution of General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda.\nIn the first month of his second term, Trump also pardonedRoss Ulbricht, a former tech entrepreneur serving a life term in federal prisonfor creating Silk Road, a dark web internet site that became a major conduit for drug traffickers.\n\"Ulbricht also demonstrated a willingness to use violence to protect his criminal enterprise and the anonymity of its users, soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there is no evidence that these murders were actually carried out,\"federal prosecutors said in a statementafter Ulbricht was sentenced in 2015.\nCommenting on background, the White House spokesman said there is no contradiction between Trump's tough-on-dealers rhetoric and his decisions to free some individuals involved in drug trafficking.\n\"The punishment does not always fit the crime,\" the spokesman said. \"The president is open to seeing if these people are worthy of redemption.\"\nSome critics of the U.S. drug war offered cautious praise of Trump's use of presidential authority to free drug offenders.\n\"President Trump's potential decision to grant clemency to people with drug convictions offers a crucial lifeline to those affected and affirms what communities have long known: Criminalization of drugs is ineffective and harmful,\" said Kassandra Frederique, head of the Drug Policy Alliance, in a statement sent to NPR.\nBut Frederique is critical of Trump's wider stance on drug policy. \"These individual acts of clemency starkly contrast with the administration's broader tough-on-crime rhetoric and its ongoing efforts to dismantle lifesaving health services,\" Frederique said.\nDuring his final days in office,President Joe Biden pardoned thousands of offenders, many of them incarcerated on federal drug charges. Biden said the move reflected his growing unease with the drug war.\n\"This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars,\" Biden said.\nDrug policy experts interviewed by NPR said it's difficult to find a coherent philosophy behind Trump's use of clemency. According to the Cato Institute's Singer, Trump's pardons often appear \"transactional\" and often reflect the influence of powerful individuals.\n\"He actually promised in front of the Libertarian Party convention that if he was elected he would pardon Ross Ulbricht. That was a promise he made hoping to get support from Libertarians,\" Singer said. \"It's not like there's an ideological thread running through [Trump's] decisions.\"\nDuring that campaign appearance in 2024, Trump openly linked his plan to commute Ulbricht's sentence to his bid for the White House. \"If you vote for me, on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht to a sentence of time served,\"Trump said, sparking applause from Ulbricht's supporters.\nThe release of Larry Hoover, meanwhile, was championed by the artist Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — who thanked Trump this week on the social media platform X. \"WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR OUR DEVOTED ENDURING PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR FREEING LARRY HOOVER,\"Ye wrote.\nDuring his first term, Trump pardoned and freed Alice Marie Johnson after thereality TV star Kim Kardashian called for her release.  Johnson was convicted in 1996 and sentenced to life behind bars for her nonviolent role as part of a Memphis, Tenn., cocaine trafficking ring. Earlier this year,Trump appointed her to serve as his \"pardon czar.\"\nIn a social media post, Johnson, too, praised the president's latest round of pardons.\n\"Today 26 deserving individuals were granted clemencies and pardons. Each one represents a story of redemption, rehabilitation, and resilience,\"Johnson said on the platform X. \"Their second chance is a second shot at life.\"",

But the details of those agreements remain murky, even after Democratic lawmakers demanded answers.\n\"The problem with the law firm deals is … they're not deals at all,\" said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor and former dean at Yale Law School. \"You know, a contract that you make with a gun to your head is not a contract.\"\nMost every American law student takes a course about contracts. And there, Koh said, they learn there needs to be a meeting of the minds. In many cases, what Trump has said in news conferences and social media posts about those deals does not match what the law firms communicated to their partners.\nThe pro bono commitments started with agreements to help military veterans. But Trump has moved the bar since to include trade deals, immigration enforcement cases and perhaps even defendingpolice officersunder investigation for misconduct.\nEven in the context of a veteran, Koh said, \"what if the veteran is gay or wants to have transgender surgery? Would they approve of that? So that lack of clarity and specificity is all the more reason why there's no deal and no meeting of the minds.\"\nShortly after Trump came into office for a second term, he signed an executive orderbanning transgender individualsfrom serving in the military.\nMeanwhile, thelaw firms that have challenged Trump's actions are fighting — and winning — in court.\nThis week, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled the executive order against the WilmerHale firm amounted to \"a staggering punishment\" for once employing lawyers like former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, who investigated Trump's ties to Russia, and representing the Democratic National Committee.\n\"The cornerstone of the American system of justice is an independent judiciary and an independent bar willing to tackle unpopular cases, however daunting,\"wroteJudge Richard J. Leon. \"The Order is intended to, and does in fact, impede the firm's ability to effectively represent its clients!\"\nKoh and others argue that a deal reached under coercion — after executive orders that three different judges have found unconstitutional — is no deal at all.\nSteven Brill, who foundedThe American Lawyermagazine and the Court TV network, said the decision of several big firms to surrender to Trump's demands represents a \"terrible development\" that's kept him up at night.\nHe said he accepts a measure of responsibility for the more mercenary culture of some major law firms, following his decision to become the first to publish economic data about firms and their partners' earnings in his magazine decades ago. That's made it easier for top attorneys to switch firms to make more money, chipping away at the bonds of partnership.\n\"You know, they didn't grow up in a law firm,\" he said. \"They didn't have the collegiality. And a lot of people blameThe American Lawyerfor that. And I think I have to accept that blame.\"\nYet Brill said it's ironic that many of the firms that settled with the White House pride themselves on their deal-making acumen, given significant questions about the enforceability about the deals they reached. He's been talking with partners at some of the settling firms.\n\"I asked one of the partners who made one of these deals, 'What prevents the president from waking up on the wrong side of the bed tomorrow morning and deciding to issue another executive order against you? What protection do you have?'\" Brill said.\nThe partner replied, \"Nothing, you know, nothing protects me,\" Brill recalled.\nThe nine law firms who Trump said agreed to deals with him declined to comment to NPR about their contracts with the president, or didn't respond to a request for comment.\nRep. April McClain Delaney, a Democrat from Maryland and a longtime regulatory attorney, has led an effort this year to get answers from the nine settling law firms. She and 15 other lawmakers asked whether the deals exposed the firms to legal or ethical liability.\nThose are real risks, especially when it comes to conflicts of interest between the settling firms and their clients, and even possible lawsuits that pit the firms against their onetime clients, according to Natalie Orpett, the executive editor of the legal site Lawfare.\nOrpett said the big law firm deals with Trump also might violate a federal bribery statute for allegedly promising a public official something of value in exchange for recanting an executive order or not issuing one.\n\"The point of the ethics rules is to make sure that the profession operates with integrity, that it participates in its unique role in preserving and protecting the rule of law in an American democracy,\" Orpett said.\nNPR obtained the firms' written responses to the Democratic lawmakers — which Delaney summarized in an interview as \"CYA.\"\nThe Cadwalader firm wrote: \"We always put our clients' interests first.\"\n\"The Agreement is fully consistent with the Firm's legal and ethical responsibilities, as well as its core values and employment practices,\" Skadden said.\n\"We firmly believe that the agreement is proper and appropriate,\" wrote Kirkland & Ellis.\nAnd Simpson Thacher & Bartlett responded that its primary goal \"was to protect the best interests of the Firm, including our thousands of lawyers and business professionals, and our clients.\"\nMcClain Delaney said she has friends atmany of the law firms, and that she understands they made the deals legitimately fearing the White House could put them out of business.\nTrump with then-attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove attends his criminal trial at Manhattan Criminal Court in May 2024. Since becoming president again, Trump has nominated both men to other positions, with Blanche as the No. 2 official at the Justice Department.Jabin Botsford/Pool/Getty Imageshide caption\nSome of the law firms that refused to settle report losing clients. But others who took Trump to court said they have attracted new business from people who support their decision to challenge the executive orders.\n\"I would never employ one of those law firms that did that, that essentially folded under these circumstances,\" media mogul Barry Dillertold Bloomberg Newslast month.\nFederal judges appointed by presidents from both political parties — and other authorities — are slowly warning of broader consequences for the legal profession and the democracy.\nFor instance, the State Bar of California recently warned that the Trump administration's orders threaten core principles of the rule of law.\n\"Such actions directly imperil the ability of lawyers at these firms to competently represent their clients and have a chilling effect on the availability of competent legal counsel to represent clients unpopular with the administration,\" the May 9bar statement said.\nThe bar statement said the White House orders could cause extra harm to people with limited means, who need free legal services. McClain Delaney, the Maryland Democrat, put it a bit more bluntly.\n\"Pro bono was never for the United States government or for a billionaire president,\" she said. \"That's a little obscene, right? Pro bono is for those who are under attack, not the attack dog.\"\nMike Howell, of the conservative-leaning Oversight Project, said the legal industry for decades has overwhelmingly provided free services to liberal groups. He's been writing big law firms this year to try to change that.\n\"We have a very large legal appetite,\" Howell said. \"We asked a lot of firms for support. We're interested in constitutional issues, we're interested in First Amendment issues, we are certainly interested in immigration enforcement and steps that states and other localities are taking to obstruct, evade or otherwise impede the lawful enforcement of immigration law.\"\nAt this early stage of negotiations, Howell said he did not want to provide details about which firms are expressing openness to his outreach and which have said \"hell no.\"\n\"We see a unique moment in time where the legal industry, I think, recognizes that it needs to return to normalcy, where your access to pro bono services or litigation support is not influenced by your ideological or partisan affiliation.\"\nThe White House said the deals are meant to hold Big Law accountable.\n\"Instead of using their power and influence to make our country dangerous and less free, Big Law is working to use its access to the federal government for good,\" Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said about Trump's deals with the firms.\nFor Yale law professor Koh, the judiciary's disdain for these executive orders, so far, could present a \"second chance\" for the firms that chose the path of settlement.\nAs he told graduates of the George Washington University Law School at theirrecent commencement ceremony: \"What you decide is a choice. And when your moment comes — and believe me, it will — please make sure that the decision you make is one you can live with.\"",

        "content": "All Things Consideredproducer Mia Venkat holding up the \"buff\" her friends made for theirSurvivorgames.Dave Maserhide caption\nWhether you watch it or not, you've likely heard ofSurvivor. For 25 years now, millions of people have been tuning in to the reality TV show where players voluntarily get stranded in a remote landscape, battling for food and supplies, competing in physical and mental challenges, voting each other off … duking it out for the title of \"Sole Survivor\" and a chance to win 1 million dollars.\nFor me, and the rest of the show's passionate fan base, it's much more than just reality TV.\nI first got intoSurvivorduring the pandemic when I was looking for something to binge-watch. I saw it while scrolling through my options, which reminded me of how badly my friend Tyler Pincus wanted me to watch the show. He's the true embodiment of a superfan — not only has he seen every season, he's watched some of them more than five times.\n\"Survivoris like 75% of my personality,\" Pincus told me. \"It's just a perfect combination of everything. You have funny moments, touching moments. You have strategy, you have physical competitions. People talk about how it's a microcosm of society and how it's the ultimate social experiment — and it really is.\"\nI was hooked almost immediately, and got my other friends hooked, too. We started watching old seasons at the same time and holding watch parties for the current seasons.\nOkay, if you're not a fan of the show, here's the gist: players compete in challenges for immunity, which saves them from being voted out that round. Players get voted out one by one until only a few remain.\nTo not get voted out, yes, you have to win challenges but you also have to build alliances, have good social strategy and be willing to be cutthroat. That's the motto of the game: Outwit, Outplay, Outlast. At the end, the finalists argue their case to a jury of eliminated players as to why they think they played the best game. The jury then votes for the \"Sole Survivor\" — winner of the season.\nIn 2022, we decided we wanted to put that ultimate social experiment to the test and recreate the game for ourselves. We spent a day in Malcolm X Park in Washington, D.C. split into tribes, playing games from the show, doing tribal councils, scheming and voting each other out until we ended with a winner.\nFrom left to right: Nick Ahern, Jarrett Chounaird and Will Slook are locked in \"jail\" in a game of capture-the-flag because they are losing badly.Dave Maserhide caption\nAnd we've leveled up every year since — bigger groups, three day weekends, traveling to different locations, with folks from all over the country flying in. There are friends that have known each other for 10 years, given speeches at each other's weddings, and there are people meeting each other for the first time. Some are superfans, and others haven't even watched a full season.\nThe friends not keen on competing become our valiant team of producers — recording content and posting updates live for ourloyal Instagram fanbase(almost 200 followers).\nA post shared by Survivor: Collegeville (@survivorcollegeville)\nEach year, two new players take their turn at running the game — they're our Jeff Probst, the longtimeSurvivorhost. \"The Jeffs\" spend the year planning out the challenges and sick new twists. They also deal with all the logistics — like how many hard seltzers a group of 20 might go through in a few days.\nThis past Memorial Day weekend, we had our fourth annual games, this time in Collegeville, Pa. My best friends from college, Anna Wickham and Care Shoaibi, were our Jeff Probsts.\nCare Shoaibi and Anna Wickham, role play as Jeff Probst — longtime Survivor host. They're reading the votes to see who will be eliminated from the game next.Dave Maserhide caption\nWickham says, over the past year, she's probably spent 200 hours planning.\n\"But if I'm talking [hours] I was lying awake at night thinking of a twist or a new advantage or something that our friends had never seen before, I mean I don't want to say four figures, but it's a lot. This has been pretty consuming in really the happiest, best way for me.\"\nTogether, the two of them planned a gauntlet of challenges — some harkening back to Survivor favorites, and some cooked up in their evil minds. This year, they decided to resurface a particularly scarring challenge from last year's game — Crisco Watermelon. Picture one watermelon in the middle of the field, with all players covered in Crisco. They then have to wrestle each other to be the last one holding the watermelon (also covered in Crisco, by the way) when time is up.\nIan Scaduto (L) and Justin Grant (R) try to wrestle the Crisco-covered watermelon out of Juliana McCormick's death grip. They are not successful.Dave Maserhide caption\nWe strategize, we blindside each other, we build and break alliances, we brutally vote each other off for the chance to win zero dollars and a year's bragging rights.\nIt's frankly the most anxiety-inducing weekend of the year, with every waking and sleeping moment spent worrying that your allies are lying to you and that you'll be out next. The only time I'm not thinking about getting blindsided is when I'm fighting for my life trying to do a \"swim pacer test\" where players had to swim back and forth at faster and faster speeds (I dropped out almost immediately, I know my strengths).\nNick Shafik (L) and Patrick Rice (R) try to talk strategy in secret while, unbeknownst to them, a sly Elise Huppert eavesdrops on their plans.Dave Maserhide caption\nSometimes, though, my strategy doesn't work out. Like this year, when I played an immunity idol for myself — an object that cancels out any votes cast against you — only to very publicly be told it was not a real immunity idol. I was swiftly and humiliatingly voted out.\nStill, this weekend is the highlight of my year, every year. I don't get to see a lot of these friends that often, and I love that a shared love of \"committing to a bit\" can bring us together like this.\nAnd it's funny to think about how Tyler Pincus's borderline concerning love ofSurvivorstarted it all:\n\"I'm just honored to be a part of this thing,\" he told me.\n\"And it's the best thing in my life.\"\nAt the final tribal council, jury member Tyler Pincus asks his question to the three finalists (from left to right) Justin Grant, Juliana McCormick and Nick Richardson.Dave Maserhide caption\nAfter we're all packed up and ready to leave Collegeville, there's one last thing to do. Wickham and Shoaibi sign their Jeff Probst hats and pass the torch to the two new Jeffs for next year. I'm told planning for ourSurvivorSeason 5 is already aggressively underway.",

The states most heavily impacted — Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota — have all issuedair quality alertsfor their residents.\nAlerts in Wisconsin and Michigan counties are in effect until Saturday, with both states warning that the quality of air will become unhealthy for sensitive groups, including children, anyone with respiratory issues and older people.\nIn Minnesota, where the entire state is under alert for compromised air quality, the state's Pollution Control Agency warned that air quality was expected to reach the red category — impacting both sensitive groups and some members of the general public. The Minnesota alert is in effect until Monday.\nRecent studies have underscored the health dangers of breathing in wildfire smoke. This week, an analysis published in the journalEpidemiologyfound that the risk of going to the hospital for cardiorespiratory problems like hypertension or heart attack rose for months after exposure to smoke — showing that the health effects can linger long after the fires themselves have been put out.\nThis crop of wildfires has struck an already fire-weary nation, after two consecutive years of some of the most destructive wildfires on record.\nThe deadly 2023 wildfire season was the worst in Canada's history, affecting all 13 of the country's provinces and territories. In 2024, while still dealing with fires carried over from the previous year, the nation fared only slightly better, experiencing its worst outbreak of wild blazessince 1995, excluding 2023.\nLike in 2023, the impacts of the wildfires aren't confined to Canada. Wildfire smoke is pouring over the border into the U.S., impacting air quality and health hundreds of miles from the fires themselves.\nThe U.S. has also battled increasingly devastating wildfires over recent years asclimate changehas made larger wildfires more likely and more intense.\nEarlier this year, a deadly blaze ripped through Los Angeles for the month of January, killing at least29 peopleand destroyingmore than 12,000homes and buildings.\nNPR's Alejandra Borunda contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland on Monday.Andy Buchanan/AFP via APhide caption\nLONDON — The United Kingdom will build new nuclear-powered attack submarines, get its army ready to fight a war in Europe and become \"a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday, part of a boost to military spending designed to send a message to Moscow — and Washington.\nStarmer said Britain \"cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\" as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to British defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.\n\"The threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.\nLike other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nThe government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's war in Ukraine, and by the reelection of President Donald Trump last year.\nMonths after Britain's last major defense review was published, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.\nStarmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.\nThe measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \"learning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia.\nThe government said the U.K, will invest in innovation and establish a cyber command to counter \"daily\" Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.\nOther measures include:\n— Building \"up to 12\" nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the U.S\n— Investing 15 billion pounds ($20.3 billion) in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines\n— Increasing Britain's conventional weapons stockpiles with six new munitions factories and up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons\n— Developing new airborne and land drones as well as a \"hybrid Navy\" of autonomous vessels and crewed ships\n— Committing 1 billion pounds for U.K. air defenses\n— A home guard to protect critical national infrastructure as part of a \"whole-of-society approach\" to defense. It was quickly branded a \"Dad's Army,\" after the World War II-set sitcom\nStarmer said rearming would create a \"defense dividend\" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs — a contrast to the post-Cold War \"peace dividend\" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.\nDefense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \"a message to Moscow,\" and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers — currently at a two-century low of about 74,000 — to rise until the early 2030s.\nHealey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \"on track\" and that there's \"no doubt\" it will hit 3% before 2034.\nBut Starmer said the 3% goal is an \"ambition,\" rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.\nJames Cartlidge, defense spokesman for the main opposition Conservative Party, said \"a defense review without the funding is an empty wish list.\"\nEven 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.\nIt's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.\nEuropean countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don't pull their weight.\nStarmer said his government would make \"Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.\"\n\"We will never fight alone,\" he said. \"Our defense policy will always be NATO-first.\"\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at defense think tank RUSI, said the review set out \"a vision ... of what the armed forces should look like in future\" but lacked key details.\n\"This is a statement of intent,\" he said. \"It's not a road map.\"",

A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth from Europe's highest active volcano.Giuseppe Distefano/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nItaly's Mount Etna produced a spectacularly explosive eruption Monday morning, sending a ripple of reddish clouds down from its summit. The soaring ash rose to form a mushroom cloud high above Etna,Europe's highest active volcano, triggering a red alert for aviation crews in the region.\nThe National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology's Etna Observatory in Catania estimated the volcanic cloud's height at about 21,325 feet. The massive ash cloud was moving in a west-southwest direction, according to the agency, known as INGV.\nThe dramatic scene at Etna's southeast crater was caught on multiple webcams, spreading quickly across social media. As seen in aWeather Sicily webcam video, the eruption rapidly grew from a few lava flows to cascades of boiling ash and smoke that rose into a large cloud.\nThankfully, the eruption doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area, other than forcing officials to halt tourists' visits to the volcano, which is a popular destination and is located on the east coast of Sicily.\nOfficials believe that a large portion of the crater collapsed, according to the Italian news agencyANSA.\nAviation alerts were easedlater on Mondayas the INGV said volcanic activity and ash emissions were finally decreasing. With the ash cloud moving toward the west, operations at Vincenzo Bellini Catania Airport, due south of Etna, weren't affected.\nIt's not unusual for Etna to emit lava and gases from its summit craters. Etna is \"the most active stratovolcano in the world that has continuously pumped ash and lava\" for thousands of years, according tothe United Nations. (A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is often steep and conical, according to theU.S. Geological Survey. In contrast,shield volcanoes, like Hawaii's Mauna Loa, are larger but with a more gradual slope.)\nEtna has a long history of frequent eruptions,documented at least to 1500 B.C.\nMost of Etna's eruptions are\"Strombolian eruptions\"— ejections of cinder, gas and molten lava that result from repeated, but relatively small, explosions.\n\"The Strombolian activity generally affects a limited area around the vent and is not an agent of risk [to] built up areas\" around Etna, according to Italy'sCivil Protection Department. Etna's lava flows are also normally viscous and slow-moving, often allowing authorities to intervene to redirect flows that threaten communities.\nEtna's eruptions have produced striking scenes over the years, from avivid nighttime display in 2011to an outburst thatpreceded an earthquake in 2018.",

The election is widely seen as a referendum on the impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol and the governing conservative party.\nCandidate Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to win. He has mostly kept a double-digit lead in polls over his conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, throughout the race.\nBut whoever is elected, the new president will have little time for celebration.\nThe election comes nearly two months after President Yoon wasremoved from officeafter hisimpeachmentfor declaring martial law in the country. The intense confrontation both in the South Korean Parliament and among the public over Yoon's fateful act has aggravated the country's political polarization and shaken South Koreans' confidence in their democracy.\nLee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate for South Korea's Democratic Party, gestures onstage on Monday during his final election campaign event ahead of Tuesday's presidential election in Seoul.Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nAnd during the leadership vacuum, tariff threats from the Trump administration have intensified, and North Korea has grown closer with Russia.\nBoth of the leading candidates from the two major parties have pledged to unite the nation.\nBut they each represent South Korea's deepening division themselves.\nFront-runner Lee Jae-myung has clashed with Yoon's government as leader of the opposition, afterclosely losing to Yoonin the 2022 presidential election. Yoon vetoed a record number of bills passed by the opposition-controlled parliament, and Lee's party impeached a series of government officials.\nAfter Yoon declared martial law in December, Lee led his party in overturning it and eventually impeaching Yoon.\nHe has called this election \"a decision between a return of insurrectionists and a rebirth into a new democratic republic.\"\nHis rival Kim, who served as Yoon's labor minister, has opposed the former president's impeachment and resisted calls to cut ties with him.\nIn an emergency parliamentary session in December, when an opposition lawmaker demanded that Yoon's Cabinet members apologize to the nation over the martial law declaration, Kim was the only one who refused to stand up and bow down.\nPresidential candidate Kim Moon-Soo of the People Power Party speaks on Sunday during a campaign rally ahead of the presidential election, in Seoul, South Korea.Daniel Ceng/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nConservative voters' support for Kim as their presidential candidate has since soared, even as his popularity among the general public in earlypollslagged behind other aspiring conservative candidates who were more critical of Yoon.\n\"South Korean society became increasingly polarized through the three years of the Yoon administration and the five years of the previous administration,\" Heo Jinjae, the research director of public opinion analysis at Gallup Korea, said at a recent news conference.\nIn 2016, South Koreaimpeached another conservativepresident over charges of corruption and bribery.\nNearly half of the governing party lawmakers voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye then. But this time, just over 10% did, \"even as the reasons for Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment were much more serious than Park Geun-hye's,\" says Ha Shang Eung, a political scientist at Sogang University in Seoul.\nThe public was also less united this time. Around 80% of South Koreans supported Park's impeachment, according topolls, but only around 60% wanted to impeach Yoon.\nAnd the president's supporters reacted more aggressively this time. In January, when a court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, more than 100 of his supporters smashed the court's windows and stormed inside.\nExperts say South Korea's polarization is more emotional than ideological.\n\"It's not a matter of positions on an issue or a policy. People just hate the other side. It's an emotional polarization. So it becomes a clash between us versus them, the good versus the bad,\" says politics professor Yoo Sung-jin of Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nIn a post-electionsurveyby Gallup Korea in 2022, \"resentment of the other candidate\" was among the top reasons voters chose one of the two main candidates.\nYoo says political parties have increasingly relied on harsher rhetoric and extreme positions to appeal to more hard-line supporters.\nOn the campaign trail, the conservative candidate Kim has echoed the impeached president's accusations of the opposition as \"pro-communist,\" saying he will \"punish\" them for \"trying to turn this great democratic country into something worse than Hitler, Kim Jong Un, Stalin, and Xi Jinping's country.\"\nYoon's staunch followers have also repeated his unfounded allegations of election fraud and judicial bias.\nMeanwhile, South Koreans' trust in democracy has declined.\nIn a recentsurveyby the Seoul-based think tank East Asia Institute, over 30% of people expressed doubts about election fairness. And among supporters of the governing party, 30% said dictatorship can be better than democracy.\nSupporters of South Korean presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party wait for him to come for a campaign rally on Monday in Seoul, South Korea.Woohae Cho/Getty Imageshide caption\nSince the presidential campaign began, the liberal candidate Lee has tried to woo more moderate voters, stressing pragmatism and national interest. He even said that his party is a \"center-right party.\"\nHe has also vowed to advance South Korea's alliance with the United States and continue its trilateral cooperation with Japan, appearing to soothe conservative voters' concerns about his foreign and security policy positions.\nAt the same time, he has distanced himself from a more progressive agenda, such as enacting an anti-discrimination bill and amending the rape law to include nonconsensual sex.\nBut if he is elected as expected, it remains to be seen whether his rightward policy shifts will help bridge the emotional gap with his fiercest critics.\nIn a recentpoll, a majority of respondents said they find Lee \"unlikeable.\" The response was particularly strong among young men and older voters — groups that have supported the impeached president the most.\nLee also has unresolved questions about several court trials he is facing over charges of corruption and election law violations, which he has claimed are politically motivated.\nAnd if elected, he would need to confront these challenges quickly. The president-elect of this snap election immediately assumes the position, with a simplified inauguration ceremony and no transition period.",

Both sides had pledged to present written proposals for a future peace deal — but that exchange didn't go smoothly.\nWhile Ukraine submitted its draft in advance, Russia withheld its version until the meeting began, drawing complaints of \"gamesmanship\" from Kyiv's delegation.\nIn the end, the talks lasted just over an hour and produced little movement on long-term peace. Still, there was one concrete outcome: an agreement to expand prisoner exchanges.\nThis image taken from video released Sunday by the Ukrainian Security Service shows a Ukrainian drone striking Russian planes deep in Russia's territory.Ukrainian Security Service/APhide caption\nOn Sunday, Ukraineattacked Russiawith a series of drone strikes on military air bases deep in the Russian heartland — an operation that appeared timed to influence Monday's talks in Istanbul.\nAfter more than three years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, this carefully planned attack, intended to hit bombers that launch missiles on Ukrainian cities, was celebrated by Ukrainians, who called it \"Operation Trojan Trucks\" on social media.\nUkraine's Security Service smuggled first-person view drones laden with small explosives onto trucks driven deep into Russia. The operation was recognized by Ukrainian officials as a much-needed win.\n\"The enemy has been bombing our country almost every night from these aircraft, and today they actually felt that retaliation is inevitable,\" Vasyl Malyuk, the head of Ukraine's Security Service,saidin a statement.\nThe drones — deployed from trucks parked along highways in proximity to Russian military installations — were used to strike 41 heavy bomber jets in bases as far away as Murmansk in Russia's Arctic north and Irkutsk in Siberia, more than 2,700 miles away from the Ukrainian border.\nMalyuk said the drones were hidden under the roofs of wooden cabins placed on trucks. These roofs were opened remotely, and the drones flew out to hit the Russian bombers, he said.\n\"Our strikes will continue as long as Russia terrorizes Ukrainians with missiles and Shaheds,\" he said, referring to the Iranian-designed drones that have played a central role in Russia's aerial assault on Ukraine.\nIn this undated photo provided by the Ukrainian Security Service, head of the Security Service Vasyl Malyuk studies a photo of a map of Russia's strategic aviation location in his office in Ukraine.Ukrainian Security Service/APhide caption\nIn an earlierstatementabout the operation, officially dubbed \"Spiderweb,\" Ukraine's Security Service claimed it destroyed $7 billion worth of Russia's strategic aviation with the strikes — about a third of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers.\nNews of the operation was the talk of both Russia and Ukraine.\nOne video posted online shows the drones take off from a truck bed parked along a highway as the Russian narrator let obscenities fly. Another shows a Russian serviceman swearing into the camera as planes burn behind him. Onepro-Kremlin military blogger referredto the attack as a \"Russian Pearl Harbor.\"\nIn hisevening video addresson Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the \"perfectly prepared\" operation using 117 drones had been planned for more than a year and a half under the nose of Russia's security service.\n\"Our people operated in different Russian regions in three time zones,\" he said. \"And our people were taken out of Russian territory on the eve of the operation. Those who helped us are safe.\"\nRussia's Defense Ministry laterconfirmed the attacks on the military basesbut played down their impact — claiming \"only several pieces of aviation technology caught fire.\"\nThe ministry also said its forces had thwarted additional attacks on three other bases and made several arrests, without providing details. It added no one had been injured in the attacks.\nNeither the Ukrainian or Russian claims about damage from the strikes could be independently verified.\nThe drones were far from the only incidents over the weekend.\nAt least seven people were killed and more than 104 injured after a bridge collapsed on a passenger train traveling through western Russia's Bryansk region Saturday night — sending debris and several trucks onto the train compartments below.\nImages shared on social media showed stunned passengers trying to climb out of smashed carriages in the dark.\nMeanwhile, Russian railway authorities say a separate rail bridge collapsed in the neighboring Kursk region hours later — derailing a freight train and injuring several crew members.\nRussia's Investigative Committee said it had launched a criminal probe into both incidents on terrorism grounds — but pulled back on initial claims the bridges had both collapsed due to planted explosives.\nIn this photo released by Russian Emergency Ministry Press Service telegram channel on Sunday, emergency employees work at a damaged bridge in Russia's Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine.Russian Emergency Ministry Press Service/APhide caption\nStill,several prominent Russian politicianswere quick to blame Ukraine and suggest it was reason enough to continue the war at any cost.\n\"Our answer will be a buffer zone so large that it prevents the penetration of terrorists onto our territory in the future,\" Andrei Klishas, a senior member of Russia's upper house Federation Council,wrote on the Telegrammessaging app.\nWhile Ukrainian authorities did not comment on either train derailment, Ukraine's military intelligence didconfirma hit on a Russian military train moving supplies in an occupied part of the Ukrainian region of Zaporizhzhia.\nRussia also carried out attacks — launching more than 470 drones and several missiles at targets across Ukraine, in what Ukrainian authorities said was the largest single-day air assault since the war began.\nThe most deadly: what Ukraine's armysaidwas a \"missile strike on the location of one of the training units\" — killing a dozen soldiers and injuring more than 60. Ukraine's military rarely confirms losses and did not disclose the precise location of the training camp, though Zelenskyy said in his evening address that it was in Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region.\nThe commander of Ukraine's armed forces, Maj. Gen. Mykhailo Drapatyi, submitted his resignation after the attack \"out of a personal sense of responsibility\" for the casualties. \"An army where no one is held responsible for losses dies from within,\" hewroteon his Facebook page.\nUkraine has also accused the Kremlin of massing some 50,000 troops at its border near Sumy in northeastern Ukraine in advance of a possible summer offensive — even as Kyiv and Moscow have engaged in some of their first direct peace talks in over three years amidpressure from the Trump administration.\nThe weekend action came only a day ahead of thesecond round of negotiationsin Istanbul.\nUkraine's lead negotiator, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, said both sides agreed to prioritize prisoner swaps involving the sick, wounded, and young detainees under the age of 25 — as well as the exchange of the bodies of those killed in combat.\nKremlin aide and chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Moscow would return the remains of 6,000 Ukrainian soldiers and accept the bodies of any Russian soldiers Ukraine may be holding.\nOne unexpected moment came when Medinsky floated the idea of short, staggered ceasefires along the front lines — not as a move toward peace, but as a \"sanitation measure\" during the summer heat, so each side could collect their dead.\nPresident Trump has been a strong advocate for the direct talks — saying their progress, or lack thereof, will do much to determine the future of U.S. engagement in the Ukraine conflict.\nEven as Trump hasthreatened more sanctions against Moscowover its perceived slow-walking of the negotiations, he and his administration have also made clear they believe Ukraine should accept it cannot beat its larger neighbor militarily and that it should make concessions.\nYet if Russia was seen as driving the terms of negotiations, political observers in Moscow suggested Ukraine's surprise drone operation had at least undermined that dynamic for now.\nWriting onsocial mediaahead of the talks, Moscow-based analyst Georgi Bovt commented, \"The Ukrainian delegation is headed to Istanbul clearly not feeling itself the 'losing side of the war.' \"\nBovt recalled that Trumponce told Zelenskyy the Ukrainians\"don't have the cards right now\" to negotiate a favorable end to the war.\n\"Apparently, they found them,\" Bovt added.\nNPR producer Hanna Palamarenko contributed to this report from Kyiv.",

In an appearance on a podcast before the election,Trump suggested that Zelenskyy was to blamefor the invasion.\n\"He should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,\" Trump said then, adding that President Joe Biden had \"instigated that war.\"\nHere is a look at how the Trump administration's efforts to bring about a peace have fared.\nWeeks after his inauguration, Trumpmade separate callsto Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then announced plans for an in-person meeting with the Russian leader in Saudi Arabia.\n\"I think we're on the way to getting peace,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I think President Putin wants peace, and President Zelenskyy wants peace. I want peace. I just want to see people stop getting killed.\"\nBut days later, it wasn't Trump and Putin sitting down together — instead, Secretary of State Marco Rubiomet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. In any case, the U.S. willingness for a high-level meeting with Kremlin officials that seemingly cut out Ukraine signaled a fundamental shift from the Biden administration policy.\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also suggested that Kyiv would have topermanently cede some territory illegally seized by Russia, including Crimea, a Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Since the start of the war, retaking Crimea has been a key strategic goal for Ukraine.\nInitially, Zelenskyy rejected a White House proposal offering the U.S.access to Ukraine's critical mineral reservesas compensationfor past military and financial support, as well as a means to secure future aid.\nHe later relented, traveling to Washington for anow-infamous meetingat the White House on Feb. 28 to finalize the deal. During an extraordinary Oval Office moment captured by media outlets, President Trump and Vice President Vance publicly scolded Zelenskyy, accusing him of lacking gratitude for American assistance.\nAs discussions turned to potential peace negotiations, Trump remarked, \"You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having the cards.\" Zelenskyy, remaining composed, replied: \"I'm not playing cards. I'm very serious, Mr. President.\"\n\"I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,\"Trump posted on his social media platform after the meeting. \"I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"\nJust days after Zelenskyy's meeting in the Oval Office, the White House announced it wassuspending critical aidand intelligence sharing with Ukraine — a decision that risked undermining Kyiv's position on the battlefield and potentially giving Russian forces a strategic advantage.\nUkraine announced it would accept a limited 30-day ceasefire, provided Russian forces reciprocated. While Putin rejected a broader truce, he didagreeto an immediate halt to strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.\nDuringhigh-level talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with Ukrainian officials, the United States pledged to resume providing aid and intelligence to Kyiv. In a joint statement, both governments described the discussions as \"important steps toward restoring durable peace for Ukraine.\"\nAt asubsequent meeting in Riyadh, between the U.S. and Russia, Moscow agreed to aBlack Sea ceasefireaimed at ensuring safe navigation, prohibiting the use of force, and preventing commercial vessels from being used for military purposes. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov emphasized that the talks' limited scope meant \"a great many different aspects [of a ceasefire] are still to be worked through.\"\nIn a photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin meets in Moscow on March 6, 2025, with workers and wards of the Defenders of the Fatherland State Fund, the foundation supporting veterans of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Mikhail Metzel/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nRAND's Charap credits the Trump administration's efforts in securing the infrastructure and Black Sea ceasefires.\n\"A negotiation seems much more plausible now, even if it's going to be protracted and complex, than it was before [Trump] took office,\" he says. \"The U.S. pressure on the parties to move towards negotiations has produced some results and it started a process.\"\nOn April 19, Russia announces a 30-hour Easter truce, which Ukraine accepts. A wary Zelenskyysayson the Telegram communication app: \"If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20.\"\nHowever, both sides accuse each other of violating the truce.\nDays later, the U.S. proposes a peace plan that would freeze the frontlines and recognize Russian control over territories already seized in Ukraine. Kyiv would forgo NATO membership — meeting a key Kremlin demand. Both sides reject the plan, with Sergey Ryabkov, a Putin foreign policy adviser,saying\"we can't accept it all in its current form\" and Zelenskyy insisting that Ukraine will never recognize Moscow's control over Crimea. \"There's nothing to talk about here,\"Zelenskyy said.\nTrump took to theTruth Social platformto fire back, criticizing Zelenskyy's \"inflammatory statements\" that would \"prolong the 'killing field.'\"\nBut Trump — who has frequently boasted about his friendship with Putin — also expressed exasperation with Russia's continued airstrikes on Kyiv. Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying,\" adding, \"Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!\"\nDelegations from U.S., led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, from Turkey and from Ukraine attend at a meeting at Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul, on May 16, 2025.Francisco Seco/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nIn what could mark a pivotal moment in the negotiations, Russian and Ukrainian officialsmeet face-to-facein Istanbul on May 16 — their first direct talks since the invasion began. Facilitated by Turkey, the meeting resulted in a prisoner exchange, with over 1,000 detainees released by each side. However, beyond the swap, the discussions yielded little progress.\nThe Kremlin's planned talks in Istanbul on Monday are intended as a follow-up. However, despite this limited diplomatic progress, the fighting on the ground continues unabated.\nOn May 25, Russian forces launched a massivedrone and missile strikeon Ukraine — the largest attack of its kind since the war began.\nTrumpexpressed dismayat Russia's actions, reiterating that he is \"not happy\" with Putin defying efforts to secure a ceasefire. Speaking to reporters about the attack, Trump said: \"I don't know what the hell happened to Putin.\"\n\"I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don't like it at all,\" the president said. Asked if he'd consider further sanctions on Russia, he replied \"absolutely.\"\nAhead of the proposed round two talks in Istanbul, which Ukraine said it was ready to attend, Zelenskyy alsoaccusedRussia of engaging in \"yet another deception\" by not handing over its proposed peace settlement ahead of the meeting.\nJones, of CSIS, says there are possible paths forward in negotiations, but they would require difficult concessions from Ukraine — concessions Zelenskyy has so far firmly rejected. According to Jones, Kyiv \"could agree not to pursue NATO membership ... and not [to attempt] to reclaim territory currently held by Russian forces.\"",

        "content": "Presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party addresses supporters at his headquarters after the presidential election runoff in Warsaw, Poland on Sunday.Czarek Sokolowski/APhide caption\nPoland's electoral commission has declared victory for conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki in the second round of the country's tightly contested presidential election.\nSecuring 50.89% of the vote, Nawrocki defeated the liberal, pro-European Union candidate Rafal Trzaskowski by just over a percentage point.\nNawrocki campaigned on a promise to defend traditional Polish values. His opponent Trzaskowski, who is the mayor of Warsaw, had vowed to push ahead with Prime Minister Donald Tusk's plans to reinstate judicial independence and liberalize abortion laws. But with major veto powers, Nawrocki is expected to block Tusk's government in pursuit of a more nationalist agenda, much like his predecessor and outgoing President Andrzej Duda.\nNawrocki, a 42-year-old historian and amateur boxer, is new to politics and ran as an independent but was backed by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party. Positioning himself as the underdog during his campaign, Nawrocki posted videos of himself at boxing rings and shooting ranges.\nHis strongman image also gained him approval from the Trump administration. Speaking at the Warsaw Conservative Political Action Conference last week, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noemdeclared\"Nawrocki needs to be Poland's next president.\"\nHungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto is among the first within the European Union to congratulate Nawrocki, calling it a \"fresh victory for (European) patriots\" in a Facebook post. Unlike Hungary, though, Nawrocki is in favor of continued support for Ukraine, although he opposes any bid from Kyiv for NATO membership.\nDescribing his opponent Rafal Trzaskowski — a veteran politician who speaks several languages — as an out-of-touch member of the urban elite, Nawrocki styled himself as an ordinary citizen to appeal to rural areas of the country where the Catholic church has more sway.\nBoth candidates mobilized the electorate; voter turnout was 71.31% — a record for the second round of a presidential election. The razor thin margin between Nawrocki and Trzaskowski highlights a deeply divided nation.",

Putin says Russia wants to engage in peace talks, but Putin has also been ordering the most widespread and violent aerial attacks on Ukraine in years. This has led Trump to criticize Putin more and more in public — a step that's been rare over the course of Trump's two terms in office.Three years into his war on Ukraine, what does Putin really want?

The drones hit airfields including the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk region, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) from Ukraine. It is the first time that a Ukrainian drone has been seen in the region, local Gov. Igor Kobzeva said, stressing that it did not present a threat to civilians.\nThe attack was disclosed on the same day as Zelenskyy said Ukraine will send a delegation to Istanbul for a new round of direct peace talks with Russia on Monday.\nIn a statement on Telegram, Zelenskyy said that Defense Minister Rustem Umerov will lead the Ukrainian delegation. \"We are doing everything to protect our independence, our state and our people,\" Zelenskyy said.\nUkrainian officials had previously called on the Kremlin to provide a promised memorandum setting out its position on ending the war before the meeting takes place. Moscow had said it would share its memorandum during the talks.\nRussia on Sunday launched the biggest number of drones — 472 — on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine's air force said.\nRussian forces also launched seven missiles alongside the barrage of drones, said Yuriy Ignat, head of communications for the air force. Earlier Sunday, Ukraine's army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.\nThe strike occurred at 12:50 p.m., the statement said, emphasizing that no formations or mass gatherings of personnel were being held at the time. An investigative commission was created to uncover the circumstances around the attack that led to such a loss in personnel, the statement said.\nThe training unit is located to the rear of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) active front line, where Russian reconnaissance and strike drones are able to strike.\nUkraine's forces suffer from manpower shortages and take extra precautions to avoid mass gatherings as the skies across the front line are saturated with Russian drones looking for targets.\n\"If it is established that the actions or inaction of officials led to the death or injury of servicemen, those responsible will be held strictly accountable,\" the Ukrainian Ground Forces' statement said.\nRussia's Ministry of Defense said Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Oleksiivka in Ukraine's northern Sumy region. Ukrainian authorities in Sumy ordered mandatory evacuations in 11 more settlements Saturday as Russian forces make steady gains in the area.\nSpeaking Saturday, Ukraine's top army chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that Russian forces were focusing their main offensive efforts on Pokrovsk, Toretsk and Lyman in the Donetsk region, as well as the Sumy border area.",

The circumstances of both are being investigated.\nA police officer was hit accidentally by fireworks in Coutance in northwest France and placed in an artificial coma because of grave eye injuries, the national police service said.\nHundreds of people were arrested in the celebrations, which were largely peaceful but degenerated into violence in some areas.\nThe team is expected to return to a big parade on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday after clinching its first Champions League title, a 5-0 win over Inter Milan.\nAt the top of the Champs-Élysées avenue, a water cannon was used to protect the Place de l'Étoile, near the landmark Arc de Triomphe. Police said a large crowd not watching the match tried to push through a barrier to make contact with police.\nBy 2 a.m. Sunday, a total of 294 arrests had been made, including 30 people who broke into a shoe shop on the Champs-Élysées. Two cars were set alight close to Parc des Princes, police added.\nAt the Place de la Bastille, there were joyous scenes as fans climbed onto the base of the famous column, singing, dancing and letting off flares, while those around joined in.\nAt one point, motorbikes loudly revved their engines and the crowd cheered as they did laps around the column. There were no police nearby and, by 1 a.m., the atmosphere was upbeat with no tensions and plenty of singing.\nSecurity had been tightened up in anticipation of potential post-match violence and 5,400 police officers were deployed on the Champs-Élysées, other key parts of Paris, and its nearby suburbs.",

In one of the incidents, seven people were killed and dozens were injured.\nThe first bridge, in the Bryansk region on the border with Ukraine, collapsed on top of a passenger train on Saturday, causing the casualties. The train's driver was among those killed, state-run Russian Railways said.\nHours later, officials said a second train derailed when the bridge beneath it collapsed in the nearby Kursk region, which also borders Ukraine.\nIn that collapse, a freight train was thrown off its rails onto the road below as the explosion collapsed the bridge, local acting Gov. Alexander Khinshtein said Sunday. The crash sparked a fire, but there were no casualties, he said.\nRussia's Investigative Committee, the country's top criminal investigation agency, said in a statement that explosions had caused the two bridges to collapse, but did not give further details. Several hours later, it edited the statement, which was posted on social media, to remove the words \"explosions\" but did not provide an explanation.\nThe committee said that it would be investigating the incidents as potential acts of terrorism.\nRescue workers cleared debris from both sites, while some of those injured were transported to Moscow for treatment. Photos posted by government agencies in Bryansk appeared to show train carriages ripped apart and lying amid fallen concrete from the collapsed bridge. Other footage on social media was apparently taken from inside vehicles on the road that had managed to avoid driving onto the bridge before it collapsed.\nDamage to railway tracks was also found Sunday by inspectors working on the line elsewhere in the Bryansk region, Moscow Railway said in a statement. It did not say whether the damage was linked to the collapsed bridges.\nIn the past, some officials have accused pro-Ukrainian saboteurs of attacking Russia's railway infrastructure. The details surrounding such incidents, however, are limited and cannot be independently verified.\nUkraine's military intelligence, known by the Ukrainian abbreviation GUR, said Sunday that a Russian military freight train carrying food and fuel had been blown up on its way to Crimea. It did not claim the attack was carried out by GUR or mention the bridge collapses.\nThe statement said Moscow's key artery with the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region and Crimea has been destroyed.\nRussia forces have been pushing into the region of Zaporizhzhia in eastern Ukraine since Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russia took Crimea and annexed it in 2014.",

The IAEA did not immediately return a request for comment about the phone call.\nThe confidential IAEA report, which was seen by the Associated Press on Saturday, raised a stern warning, saying that Iran is now \"the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material\" — something the agency said was of \"serious concern.\"\nAraghchi emphasized to Grossi that all of Iran's nuclear activities are within the framework of agreements and being monitored by the IAEA. The IAEA said in a separate report that Iran's cooperation with the agency has been \"less than satisfactory\" when it comes to uranium traces discovered by IAEA inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.\nAraghchi also asked Grossi to ensure \"that certain parties do not exploit the agency for political agendas against the Iranian people.\" European nations could take further steps against Iran based on the comprehensive report, leading to a potential escalation in tensions between Iran and the West.\nIran's deputy foreign minister on Sunday published a detailed response, rejecting many of the report's findings. Kazem Gharibabadi noted that out of the IAEA's 682 inspections of 32 states, 493 were carried out in Iran alone.\n\"So long as a country's nuclear activities are under the IAEA's monitoring, there is no cause for concern,\" he said. \"The Islamic Republic of Iran is neither pursuing nuclear weapons nor does it possess any undeclared nuclear materials or activities.\"\nThe IAEA report said that as of May 17, Iran has amassed 408.6 kilograms (900.8 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60%.\nThat's an increase of almost 50% since the IAEA's last report in February. The 60% enriched material is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\nThe phone conversation between Araghchi and Grossi came hours after Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who is mediating the U.S.-Iran talks, visited Tehran on Saturday to present the latest U.S. proposal for ongoing talks.\nThe U.S.-Iran talks are attempting to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic, which have strained relations for almost 50 years. The fifth round of talks between the U.S. and Iran concluded in Rome last week with \"some but not conclusive progress,\" al-Busaidi said at the time.",

But at a recent 100-kilometer race in Wales, one runner took it to another level.\nAs seen in photos that quickly went viral, runner — and new mom — Stephanie Case sat down at three points along the demanding race course to breastfeed her six-month-old daughter. Case not only finished the race; she placed first among the female competitors.\n\"Well that was a surprise,\" Casewrote on Instagram, posting photos of herself feeding her daughter while wearing her racing bib and gear. \"I WON?!?\"\nCase had no idea victory awaited her at theUltra-Trail Snowdoniarace in Northern Wales. After a three-year break from competing, she was just happy to be running again. And to have a daughter, Pepper, after a long journey that included two miscarriages.\n\"I think the response has been overwhelmingly positive,\" Case, 42, tells NPR, adding that the reaction \"has shown me that we still have these ideas in our head culturally about what a new mom should look like.\"\nTo her, the photos show \"an athlete being a mom at the same time, and those things not actually competing with one another.\"\n\"We don't have to lose ourselves in becoming a mom and we can keep setting big goals for ourselves,\" she says.\nOn a practical level, Case's feat raises a key question: How did she make sure to get enough calories to power herself and a whole other human during an ultramarathon?\n\"It's not just during the race,\" she says. \"It's also in training, to make sure that my milk supply wasn't affected. It's not easy. I feel like I am eating all the time, but actually becoming a mum has made me a lot more efficient in both my training and in my fueling strategies.\"\nCase, a Canadian human rights lawyer currently based in Chamonix, France, says her coach, Dr. Megan Roche, helped to hone those strategies.\n\"During the race I was taking in about 80 to 100 grams of carbohydrates an hour,\" she says. \"And I kept that up until about 65K, and then I had to pull back a bit because I was getting quite nauseous. And then I ramped it back up again and was kind of done at 95K.\n\"That's when I started gettingreallynauseous,\" she says with a laugh.\n\"It's surprisingly technical,\" Case says of the Snowdonia course, which organizers say has6,500 meters of elevation gain(21,325 feet). Ultrarunners must traverseSnowdon(known in Welsh as Yr Wyddfa), the highest mountain in Wales, and navigate rugged terrain, from boggy fields to craggy ridges and hard shale.\n\"It's not what you would think of as a typical running race,\" Case says. In some sections, she adds, \"really it's almost like scrambling or climbing, where you're going up kind of a vertical wall of rock.\"\nCase finished with a time of just over 16 hours and 53 minutes. But she initially had no idea where she hadplaced in the race. Since she hadn't competed in recent years, Case didn't run with the main group of elite female runners — she started 30 minutes later — and had no sense of their pace.\nCase's partner brought Pepper to the 20-, 50- and 80-kilometer checkpoints. She got special permission for the rendezvous at 50 kilometers, on the stipulation that she couldn't receive aid during the stop.\nIt wasn't until race officials confirmed the time recorded by her tracking chip that the wildly unexpected results emerged: A new mom in her early 40s — who stopped to breastfeed her baby along the grueling course — placed first among the more than 60 female finishers.\nStephanie Case says she wondered after she had her daughter, \"Can I still call myself an athlete?\"Rich Gillhide caption\nCase won the ultramarathon while on parental leave from her job working for the United Nations as a human rights lawyer. Her career has previously taken her to countries such as Afghanistan and South Sudan — places where running long distances helps Case cope with the stress of working in a humanitarian crisis.\nThe experiences  inspired her to foundFree to Run, a nonprofit that empowers girls and young women's in conflict areas through running and other outdoor activities.\nFor Case, the Welsh race in mid-May was her first big competition since the summer of 2022: the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run in Colorado.\n\"I got second in that race, and I was just really happy,\" she recalls.\nThen Case learned she was pregnant — \"and unfortunately, it wound up in a miscarriage,\" she says.\n\"People questioned whether it was the running that had actually caused the miscarriage,\" she says. \"And there's no science or medical research to indicate that link, but it planted a seed of doubt in my head.\"\nOnce a sanctuary from stress, Case began to wonder if running was \"something that was actually not beneficial for me or helpful for my attempts to have a family.\"\nShe began to withdraw from running. But when she got pregnant and miscarried again, \"people questioned whether it was the stress of my job that caused the miscarriage,\" she says.\n\"I felt like I was just lost without answers, without a clear path forward of what to do,\" Case says. \"When I lost the running part of me, that was a core part of my identity. That was who I was, how I identified myself, how I kind of moved through the world. And suddenly I didn't have that.\"\n\"I was dealing with the grief and all of the emotions around pregnancy loss and infertility,\" Case says. \"So when I was finally able to get a successful pregnancy through IVF, I started running again in my second trimester, not in my first trimester at all.\"\nShe felt more confident about her pregnancy, she says — up to a point.\n\"Even at like 39 weeks, I just couldn't fully relax. Once you've gone through a miscarriage, it doesn't matter what the stats say. It doesn't matter if every doctor in the world tells you, 'You'll be fine.' You don't really believe it until you actually see that baby.\"\nAs a new parent, Case has been wrestling with a new question: How should she see herself?\n\"You know, do I identify now as a mom?\" she recalls wondering. \"What's going to happen with my career? Can I still call myself an athlete?\"\nIt was a joy, she says, to return to running, to rekindle part of her identity that had gone dormant.\n\"Once I started training, I really started upping my goals,\" she says.\nHer initial hope was simply to finish a race. But that was soon replaced by larger ambitions.\n\"You know, why not set big goals?\" Case says. \"And if I don't do well, I don't do well. But let's see what we can do.\"\nWith that question now answered, Case is preparing for a familiar event: the Hardrock 100.\n\"In about six weeks I'll be going back to do that same race that kind of set me down this journey\" in 2022, Case says.\nThis time, she'll have Pepper with her.",

In Jordan, tens of thousands of boxes of food aid for Gaza are moldering in warehouses.Abed Rahim/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nAMMAN, Jordan — The main warehouse of UNRWA, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency, is stacked high with tens of thousands of cardboard boxes packed with food meant to avert malnutrition in Gaza. Prevented by Israel since March from entering Gaza, some of it is going bad.\n\"Some of the food we have is arriving at expiration in July,\" said Jonathan Fowler, anUNRWAspokesperson. That includes 200,000 metric tons of flour. And while some will be distributed if needed to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, \"some of it will have to be dumped,\" he says.\nHe pulls out Turkish chickpeas from a box that also includes packages of yeast, lentils, canned fish and sugar. The tens of thousands of boxes are calibrated for balanced meals and enough to feed 200,000 people for a month. All are moldering in warehouses along with even bigger quantities of food and medicine loaded on trucks that have now waited for months at Israeli border crossings.\nThe United States and U.S. military helped establish Jordan as the main hub for humanitarian aid to Gaza after the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas started in 2023. The kingdom is a U.S. security ally which made peace with Israel decades ago, and the Gaza border is just three hours' drive from Jordan.\nIn the face of increasing malnutrition in Gaza, Israel this week debuted a new mechanism to deliver limited amounts of aid to a small number of locations located in the south of Gaza. And U.N. officials say Israel has made it clear to them that it will no longer allow in aid from Jordan or neighboring Egypt.\n\"One of the restrictions this last week has been to only bring in goods from Israel,\" said Jonathan Whittall, head of the U.N.'s Office for Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza. \"We haven't been able to bring our goods from Egypt and from Jordan, which has limited on the medical side specifically, what we can bring in and how quickly.\"\nThe move leaves humanitarian goods valued by aid officials in the hundreds of millions of dollars stranded in overheated warehouses and at border crossings. Many of the aid organizations are now paying monthly storage fees for the supplies obtained through public and private donations.\nIsrael has alleged that Hamas was stealing aid. The U.N. — including Cindy McCain, a former U.S. ambassador and now the head of the World Food Program — along with other aid officials say Israel produced no evidence of systematic diversion of aid by Hamas. Many of the groups use proven distribution systems within Gaza built over decades.\nThe new aid organization, called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, has been widely criticized by aid officials. Few details about how the group is financed, or who works for it, have been made public.\n\"When you have armed personnel manning humanitarian sites, and you have people desperately hungry and in need of aid and not enough aid to meet the need, that's a very volatile combination,\" said Sean Carroll, president and CEO of ANERA, the biggest U.S.-based nongovernmental aid group operating in Gaza.\nThe first head of GHF, Jake Wood, resigned last Sunday,saying the organization was unable to operate according to humanitarian principles.\nCarroll says aid groups have a combined total of more than 100 million meals waiting in trucks at Israel's Kerem Shalom border crossing with Gaza. Some are actually on the Gaza side but prevented by Israel from going further. Israel has blamed the United Nations for not picking it up and distributing it.\nGHF's food distribution requires Palestinians in Gaza to travel to one of only a handful of access points in the south of Gaza, in contrast to aid groups that used a variety of distribution methods to deliver food throughout communities. The halt in aid shipments into Gaza has severely curtailed that.\n\"We've continued to make meals and deliver them, but instead of 100,000 to 150,000 a day, we've been doing 1,000 or 2,000 a day,\" Carroll says.\nUNRWA, established after the 1948 creation of Israel to care for 700,000 Palestinian refugees forced to flee their homes by war, is the primary provider of primary health care in Gaza. Fowler said their stocks of medical supplies, including basic items such as burn ointments, had been cut to half of needed supplies in the last two months.\nClaire Manera, emergency director for Doctors Without Borders, which operates emergency and other health care facilities, said the months-long ban on aid shipments has left them rationing items like antiseptics, gauze, gloves and painkillers.\n\"Not only have all our trucks in Jordan gone through the right approval processes but now they've been sitting for so long we are worried that some stock will expire,\" she said.\n\"Even the most very basic medical supplies that are critical when we're doing wound care and surgery are missing,\" she said by video call from Gaza. \"You know it's heartbreaking when I'm in the hospital like I was today and you see children in agony.\"\nThe Israeli military agency overseeing access at the Gaza border told NPR it had no details on restrictions on aid from Jordan and Egypt.\nA State Department spokesperson, when asked about U.N. and aid group comments that Israel was barring aid from Jordan and Egypt, said the reports were \"absolutely false.\" The spokesperson insisted on remaining anonymous in line with department policy.\nAid groups say aside from the ban on all aid currently stored in Jordan and Egypt is the cumulative effect of Israel's rejection of items it considers of possible military use, such as water treatment chemicals.",

        "content": "Former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams leaves the court in Dublin on Friday after winning one of Ireland's highest-profile cases.Charles McQuillan/Getty Imageshide caption\nLONDON —  Gerry Adams, the former president of Sinn Fein, the Irish republican party, has won his libel case against the BBC over a documentary that claimed he sanctioned the 2006 murder of a British spy.\nThis was one of Ireland's most high-profile lawsuits, pitting the U.K. national broadcaster against the man who transformed Sinn Fein, once the political wing of a group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and U.K. — the Irish Republican Army —into a modern political party.\nThe jury at the High Court in Dublin returned a verdict after almost seven hours of deliberations, awarding Adams damages of 100,000 euros ($113,000). The four-week trial covered Adams' alleged membership in the IRA and his role during the decades of Roman Catholic and Protestant fighting in Northern Ireland known asthe Troubles.\nAdams, 76, was the president of Sinn Fein from 1983 to 2018. He has always denied being a member of the IRA militant group.\nThe jury decided that the BBC had defamed Adams in a 2016 episode of the BBC Northern IrelandSpotlightdocumentary series and in an accompanying online story. Adams said the BBC had wrongly claimed, based on an anonymous source, that he authorized the murder ofDenis Donaldson, a British MI5 spy and former Sinn Fein official who was shot in the head in 2006.\nThe jury rejected the BBC's defense that its journalism was fair, responsible and in the public interest.\nOutside the court, Adams spoke to reporters in both Irish and English and said the case was about \"putting manners on the BBC.\" He said the BBC \"upholds the ethos of the British state in Ireland\" and that it \"was out of sync\" with theGood Friday Agreement, the 1998 peace deal that formally ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\n\"It hasn't caught on to where we are on this island as part of the process, the continuing process, of building peace and justice, and harmony, and, hopefully, in the time ahead, unity,\" he said.\nThe director of BBC Northern Ireland, Adam Smyth, told reporters outside the court he was disappointed by the verdict, saying, \"We believe we supplied extensive evidence to the court of the careful editorial processes and journalistic diligence applied to this program and the accompanying online article.\"\nThe BBC argued the claims made in theSpotlightdocumentary — that Adams had sanctioned the murder of Donaldson — were couched as allegations. Adams argued they were presented as fact.\nDonaldson was shot dead in County Donegal months after admitting he had been a spy for British intelligence, working for the police and MI5 inside Sinn Fein for twodecades.\nTheSpotlightprogram featured an anonymous source who claimed that Adams had sanctioned Donaldson's killing, saying murders had to be approved by the leadership of the IRA. When the presenter of the program asked the anonymous source whom he was specifically referring to, he replied, \"Gerry Adams. He gives the final say.\" A main issue in the trial was Adams' alleged past as an IRA leader — a claim that Adams has always rejected.\nNo one has ever been convicted in connection with Donaldson's death. The Real IRA — a dissident republican group that was born out of a split in the Provisional IRA, the group that participated in Northern Ireland's peace process —claimed responsibilityfor his killing. An investigation by the Irish police is still ongoing.",

Vautrin emphasized that the freedom to smoke \"ends where children's right to breathe clean air begins.\"\nMiddle and high schools will also be affected by the ban, particularly to prevent \"students from smoking in front of their schools,\" said Vautrin.\nAny American visitor to France will be struck by the number of smokers in general and especially the number of young peoplepuffing awayon café terraces.\nBut tobacco use in France has actually been on thedeclinein recent years. Smoking is at its lowest level since the 1990s with 23% of the adult population reporting lighting up every day. Tobacco use is also declining among young people — only 16% of 17-year-olds report smoking, whereas six years ago it was 25%.\nThe expansion of smoke-free zones is one of the measures outlined in a national plan to reduce tobacco use and achieve a tobacco free generation by 2032. Failure to comply with the ban could result in a fine of €135.\nNearly 7,000 smoke-free zones have already been created by 1,600 volunteer cities and towns, including beaches, parks, ski slopes and areas around schools.\nThe new measure has strong public support. According to a survey conducted for theFrench League Against Cancer, 78% of respondents wanted to do away with cigarettes in new public spaces.\nSpeaking to newspaper Le Monde, Daniel Thomas, a spokesperson for the French Society of Tobacco Studies called it \"an excellent measure\" that \"widens the space for denormalizing tobacco use.\"\nFrance first banned smoking inside public buildings in 2007, a ban that wasextendedto cafés, restaurants and nightclubs in 2008. Many thought the ban would be difficult to enforce considering the place the smoky café holds in French cultural lore.\nWhile it was immediately successful, smokers simply migrated outside, turning the sidewalk into the place to avoid if you're a non-smoker.\nThe French health ministryattributes around 200 deaths per day to tobacco use, making it the leading preventable cause of death.\nThe societal cost of tobacco is estimated at €156 billion a year. It is also a major pollutant, with 20,000 to 25,000 metric tons of cigarette butts discarded annually.\nThe city of Paris has just launched a new campaign to reduce the 2 billion cigarette butts left on its streets every year.\nThe new ban will not apply to e-cigarettes, which have been on the rise in the past five years with 6% of adults saying they now use them.\nOn a park bench under a tree in Paris 15th arrondissement, 26-year-old student Ouadere Thevet is enjoying a smoke. Kids play on a jungle gym nearby. Even though he won't be able to do this after June, Thevet says he's for the measure.\n\"We can always find other smoking spots like outdoor cafés,\" he says. \"This hurts kids so we shouldn't do it around them.\"\nThevet says he became a smoker after fooling around with cigarettes with his friends in his teens. He thinks the measure could have a big impact.\n\"I think restricting the places where you can smoke might actually push a lot of people to quit.\"",

        "content": "Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., left, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speak to reporters the U.S. Capitol on April 10. The Senate hopes to pass legislation in the coming weeks to enact President Trump's domestic policy priorities — a bill that has already cleared the House.J. Scott Applewhite/APhide caption\nThe fate of legislation to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda moves to the GOP-controlled Senate this week, where a handful of Republican spending hawks are criticizing the price tag of the president's mega-bill, which would grow the national debt by trillions of dollars, and calling for changes.\nIn May, the House narrowly passed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" — which would cut taxes and increase border and military spending, while scaling back spending on Medicaid, the joint federal/state health care program for low-income, elderly and disabled Americans.\nThe sweeping plan is moving through Congress under a budget process known as reconciliation. It allows Senate Republicans to pass legislation through the 100-member chamber with a simple majority, rather than requiring the body's de facto 60-vote threshold.\nIn practice, that allows Republicans to move ahead without any support from Democratic lawmakers. But with Republicans clinging to a narrow majority in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., can only afford to lose three members of his party — and several are already signaling problems with the current version of the bill.\nOn Sunday, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Fox News the bill was \"completely unsustainable\" and that he plans to hold a hearing on it before a full Senate vote. And on CBS News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he thinks there is enough Republican opposition to change the bill the House passed.\nAt the heart of the GOP bill is an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts. The plan also looks to make good on several of Trump's promises from the campaign — including a temporary pause on taxes on tips and overtime for the remainder of Trump's term.\nAccording to ananalysisof the bill's tax provisions by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the package's tax changes would raise the deficit — the gap between how much the government earns in tax revenue and how much it spends — by an estimated $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years.\nThe White House has criticized this CBO estimate, as have several Republican lawmakers.\nSince the House passed the bill, tech-billionaire Elon Musk has spoken out about its projected impact to the deficit, as has JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Speaking at an economic forum on Friday, Dimon warned continued government spending will create a \"crisis\" in the bond market by undermining public confidence in the ability of the U.S. government to pay back its debts.\nSen. Johnson agreed.\n\"It's completely unsustainable,\" Johnson told Fox News on Sunday. \"I agree with Jamie Dimon here.\"\nJohnson said he wants to return spending to pre-pandemic levels, and break up the House bill into two separate Senate bills. When asked if he is willing to \"blow up\" Trump's agenda, Johnson said he supports the president, but doesn't approve of the House bill.\n\"My loyalty is to the American people, to my kids and grandkids,\" Johnson said. \"We cannot continue to mortgage their future.\"\nSen. Paul said he and Johnson aren't the only GOP senators with concerns about the House bill's impact on the deficit.\n\"I think there are four of us at this point, and I would be very surprised if the bill at least is not modified in a good direction,\" Paul told CBS News.\nOn Saturday, Trump warned onsocial mediathat if Sen. Paul votes against the bill, \"the GREAT people of Kentucky will never forgive him!\"\nPaul has been a vocal critic of a provision in the bill to raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the nation could run out of money to pay its bills by August and trigger a potential financial crisis if Congress doesn't lift the limit before then.\nSpeaking on CBS'Face the Nationon Sunday, Bessent sought to ease GOP concerns about the deficit.\n\"The deficit this year is going to be lower than the deficit last year, and in two years it will be lower again. We are going to bring the deficit down slowly,\" he said.\nThe House bill seeks to cut hundreds of billion in spending on Medicaid by introducing new work requirement, shortening the enrollment period and eliminating what Republicans say is \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in the system.\nA CBO analysis ofa previous proposal to put work requirements on Medicaidprojected that — while federal costs would decrease — the number of people working would remain unchanged. State costs, due to the price of implementing and administering the new requirements, would increase substantially.\nSome Republicans have concerns about the Medicaid changes that go beyond their cost. Debates over Medicaid almostkilled the bill in the House, and the issue is equally contentious in the Senate.\nIn May, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., wrote inThe New York Timesthat significant cuts to Medicaid \"is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"\n\"Republicans need to open their eyes: Our voters support social insurance programs,\" Hawley wrote in an opinion piece. \"More than that, our voters depend on those programs.\"\nHawley, though, has since argued work requirements for Medicaid don't count as cuts.\nOn Friday, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, defended the House bill and its changes to Medicaid duringa fiery town hall in Iowa.\n\"When you're arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits, 1.4 million [people] … they are not eligible so they will be coming off,\" Ernst said.\nThen someone in the crowd yelled: \"People are going to die.\"\n\"Well, we all are going to die,\" Ernst responded, eliciting jeers from the audience.\nThe exchange went viral and highlighted the political stakes over Medicaid. Democrats have since criticized Ernst's response.\nThe GOP bill could also face changes in the Senate due to a quirk in the reconciliation process known as the Byrd Rule — named for the late West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd. Theruleis meant to rid legislation of \"extraneous matter\" that has limited to no impact on the deficit. It allows senators to offer amendments that strike certain aspects of a reconciliation bill.\nWhile it remains unclear what portions of the House bill will be hit by the Byrd Rule, certain non-budgetary measures could be at risk. These include House bill measures on AI regulations, judicial power, gun regulation and Planned Parenthood, among others.\nIf the Senate alters the legislation and passes a changed version of the bill, it will have to go back to the House for final approval.\nCongressional Republicans are hoping to have the bill to President Trump's desk by July 4.",

Semi-regular flights carrying detainees pass through the airport as the Trump administration continues to plan for the expansion of immigrant detention and deportation.David Ryder/Getty Imageshide caption\nNgoc Phan was preparing for her husbandto be deportedto Vietnam.\nPhan, 40, this spring had gathered luggage with clothes and a cell phone at her home just south of Seattle. Her husband was filling out paperwork and travel documents, she said. Family abroad was preparing to greet him at the airport. And in a few years, she would join him to start a brand new life together.\n\"Everything that was done up to this point, my communication with his [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] officer, him filling this declaration form, providing names of people to pick him up at the airport — there was no indication that he was going to be sent anywhere else except Vietnam,\" Phan told NPR.\nThe deportation itself did not come as a surprise. Her husband, Tuan Thanh Phan, had been serving about a 25-year prison sentence forfirst degree murderand second degree assault in 2000 after firing a gun that struck a bystander during what was labeled a gang-related dispute. He was a green card holder, whose lawful permanent residency was revoked during his sentence, in 2009, his wife said.\nHe never walked free. ICE officers picked up from the Coyote Ridge Corrections Center in Connell, Wash., on March 3, his release date, and immediately put him into deportation proceedings.\n\"We've accepted it. We planned for it, and we were looking forward to it,\" Ngoc Phan said. \"And then in the middle of the night, they picked him up and sent him to South Sudan.\"\nPhan's husband was one of several men who were first told that they would be sent to South Africa instead of their home countries — which also included Mexico, Burma, Cuba and Laos. Then they were told instead their destination would be South Sudan, apolitically unstablecountry in Africa and one of the poorest in the world.\nThe administration argues that the men's home countries won't take them — and people with criminal records shouldn't be allowed to stay in the U.S.\n\"As a career ICE officer, I've been dealing with these recalcitrant countries for years, having to see repeated murderers, sex offenders, violent criminals re-released back into the United States because their home countries would not take them back,\" ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said during a press conference.\n\"We are now able to remove these public safety threats so they won't prey on the community anymore and they won't have any more victims in the United States.\"\nButimmigration lawyers suedover the flight to South Sudan, arguing their clients weren't given enough time to contest their deportations there. The same lawyers had sued earlier to stop a deportation flightheaded to Libya, another unstable country with a notorious history of poor treatment towards migrants.\nBrian Murphy, a federal judge in Massachusetts appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, ruled in their favor, arguing migrants set to deported to anywhere that's not their country of origin need more time to contest their removal there.\nSpecifically, migrants should get an interview, known as a credible fear interview, where they have a chance to say they may face violence or persecution if sent to a specific country.\n\"Is it okay for the government then to turn around and destroy their lives and the lives of their families, just because those individuals at one time committed a crime for which they've already been convicted, they've already served their sentence?\" said Matt Adams, the legal director at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, one of the groups suing the administration over the flight to South Sudan and deportations to other so-called third countries.\n\"It's just a complete renunciation of our justice system,\" he said.\nThe strategy to rely on other countries to take in U.S. deportees is not new.\nMexico, for example, has been a past destination to remove those who cannot be returned back to their home countries. That's because countries like Cuba and Venezuela, for example, for many years didn't accept deportees from the U.S.  Other countries placed limits on the frequency of flights.\nVietnam, Tuan Thanh Phan's home, has also been on the list of countrieswith limitson accepting deportees. The country did signan agreement with the U.S. in 2020that made it easier to accept those who arrived in the U.S. before 1995; Phan arrived in 1991, said his lawyer Adams, from the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.\nThe Trump administration has prioritized getting more countries to repatriate their citizens, including from China, Venezuela and Cuba.\nStill, there can be barriers to send people to their countries of origin.\nHomeland Security Department officials justified the flight to South Sudan by arguing the home countries of the men would not accept them because of the crimes they had committed in the U.S., which included murder and sexual assault.\n\"These are the ones that you don't want in your community. These are the ones that we prioritize every day,\" Lyons, from ICE, said. He noted the State Department has been key to brokering international deals with countries to play this role.\n\"And the further away the better, so they can't come back across the border,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubiosaid during an April cabinet meeting.\nIt's unclear whether the administration first tried to deport some of the men now in Djibouti to their home countries.\nICE did not respond to questions about whether Mexico and Vietnam, the home countries of two of the men, were placing limits on deportations, whether this specific flight only included people who had entered without legal status, or how many individuals have been sent by DHS to third countries since the start of the administration.\n\"We do not comment on private diplomatic discussions surrounding the removal of any specific individual or final destination,\" a State Department spokesperson said.\nThe Vietnamese Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.\nGreg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American immigration Lawyers Association, said the difference from prior administrations includes the kinds of countries this White House is negotiating with.\n\"The principle in law is that it needs to be a safe country for that person to be removed there,\" said Chen, whose nonpartisan organization represents immigration attorneys and law students.\nThe Department of Homeland Security hasn't commented about conditions in South Sudan. But theState Department's travel advisoryfor it warns U.S. citizens not to travel there due to \"crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\"\nDHS policy requires any deportee to get notice of what country they're being sent to, \"and an opportunity for a prompt screening of any asserted fear of being tortured there.\"\nThe arguments in court have centered on how long migrants should have to contest their removal to a country. DHS says this process takes \"minutes,\" not weeks.\nIn the case of the flight to South Sudan, the men got less than 24 hours' notice.\nImmigration lawyers say such little time means deportees' have little hope of arguing against a removal, especially if they don't speak English.\nAnd ultimately, immigration attorneys say, the governmentmakes mistakes.\n\"That these deportations are happening in a rushed fashion, it means that the administration is dangerously close to violating due process in these cases,\" Chen said.\nJudge Murphy of Massachusetts did not prohibit the use of third country removals. But he said the government needs to provide notice in the deportee's language and 15 days to contest their removal to a particular country — something that didn't happen in the case of the flight to South Sudan,Murphy said.\nAfter the flight left, Murphy ordered the men stay in DHS custody while the department conducts a credible fear assessment.\nThe flight ended up landing at a military base in Djibouti where, since around May 22, the men and federal agents remain while the administration fights the orders in court.\nThe Trump administration appealed Murphy's order to the Supreme Court, arguing that the judge was interfering with the executive branch's role to carry out immigration policy and conduct international deals.\n\"Having slammed on the brakes while these aliens were literally mid-flight — thus forcing the government to detain them at a military base in Djibouti not designed or equipped to hold such criminals — the court then retroactively 'clarified' its injunction to impose an additional set of intrusive and onerous procedures on DHS,\" John Sauer, the U.S. Solicitor General,said in the appeal.\n\"While certain aliens may benefit from stalling their removal, the Nation does not. Worse, the injunction has harmed—and will harm — American foreign policy and national security,\" Sauer added.\nThe Supreme Court gave the lawyers representing the men until June 4 to respond to the appeal. The government will then get another chance to reply before the Supreme Court weighs in.\nUntil then, the men and the immigration officials are left in Djibouti.\nPhan says her husband used to call her from the detention center every morning. Now she has not heard from him since he was put on the plane.\nShe is frustrated the administration is lumping him in with others who perhaps entered the country without legal status and committed multiple crimes.\n\"I'm angry about it,\" Phan said. \"They want to call him a barbaric monster without really understanding the details of his case … He [already] did 25 years.\"",

The White House is also reserving the option to have officials travel to states if extra pressure is needed to convince Republican senators to back the bill, the official said.\nThere are a few major sticking points in play. A handful of Republican senators have said the bill istoo expensive. Others are worried that it will slash Medicaid coverage for too many people — though Trump maintains only waste, fraud and abuse would be cut.\nIt's a political balancing act. Republicans hold a narrow majority in each of the House and Senate, and are trying to use a special process known as reconciliation that will enable them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the typical 60-vote threshold normally required in the Senate.\nSo that has Trump pressuringsome Senate Republicans on social media— and he is also working the phones to make his case.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has expressed concerns about the impact the House-passed bill would have on Medicaid,said on social mediaon Monday that he had heard from Trump directly. \"He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS,\" Hawley said. (The official declined to say what other senators Trump was calling.)\nThe bill narrowly passed in the House last month — and any changes made by the Senate ultimately will need to be approved by the House. Most Republican senators are being realistic about the kind of changes they can make, the White House official said.\n\"There's not a lot of room to maneuver,\" the official said. \"The House construct fundamentally has to be the bones of the legislation — and the House construct is very beneficial for the president's priorities.\"\nBut the House may need to accept some changes in the bill because of the Byrd rule, a strict guideline requiring legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction and within a committee's jurisdiction in order for the Senate to use reconciliation to pass the legislation with a simple majority.\n\"That has always been an element of frustration for the House, but they've gotten over it in the past, and we're hopeful they'll get over it in the future, because the bill is not going to pass unless it's Byrd-compliant,\" the official said.",

        "content": "Legislation to enact President Trump's tax and spending agenda moves to the GOP-controlled Senate this week.Stefani Reynolds/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe Republican-led U.S. Senate returns from recess today to debate President Trump's \"big, beautiful\" multi-trillion dollar budget bill.\nThe plan is key to accomplishing the bulk of Trump'sdomestic policy agenda, which includes new work requirements for Medicaid recipients, increased spending for immigration enforcement, overhauling the student loan system, and ending tax breaks for clean energy.\nRon Bonjean, a Republican strategist with bipartisan public relations agency ROKK Solutions and former spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, knows the reconciliation process in the Senate. Bonjean toldMorning Editionthat while he expects some pushback from a handful of Republican senators, he ultimately expects the bill to pass.\nHe also spoke with NPR's Steve Inskeep about how Trump's presidency is changing the legislative process.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nSteve Inskeep:I'm just thinking, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, maybe even five years ago, the conventional wisdom at this point would be that Senate Republicans were a little more broad-minded than House Republicans, by which I mean the House would take an ideological or partisan vote or go for their ideal vote, and then senators would smooth out the edges or just reject their ideas. Is that still the dynamic?\nRon Bonjean:It's still the dynamic usually. But under President Trump, we are under different circumstances. I think that there is much more pressure on these Republicans to act not only because of the fact that it's the president's signature piece of legislation, but that the debt ceiling needs to be raised by August, or else we default. And that's something that's never happened before. So I think that that is an issue.\nHowever, I would say that the pressure from Trump is overwhelming. And we have never seen a bill move this fast. This is one of the largest bills in American history we've ever had to deal with. Never seen a move this fast through the House, and I think it's going to move faster through the Senate despite the Senate concerns.\nInskeep:Oh, that's really interesting, because we are hearing about enough senators objecting to this bill, in theory, to actually reject it. Josh Hawley, Republican, opposed the proposed cuts to Medicaid. He said if Republicans are going to be a party of the working class, they need to support the working class. Rand Paul, another Republican, is saying can't deal with raising the debt ceiling and adding so much debt, is it really going to be that difficult to…\nBonjean:I'd say, on deficit reductions and spending cuts, that's something that the House Freedom Caucus objected to because that is such a cerebral argument and one that does affect Americans in the long term. It doesn't affect their immediate issues in the near term. And that's why I think that the argument over Medicaid is really going to be more of the sticking point where you have Senators Susan Collins and Josh Hawley and Thom Tillis all expressing concerns. Yes, I see the bill slowing down, but I see it eventually passing once they can figure this out.\nInskeep:Can I ask about some of that — I was about to say details. But of course, these could be tens or hundreds of billions of dollars. They want to get rid of tax breaks for clean energy, for example. And I'm thinking about the way that those tax breaks had been distributed in a way that benefit, in some cases, red states. You have batteries being made in red states, you have Elon Musk's car company. There are different ways that people who were on the right benefited. Are provisions like that perhaps likely to go back into law?\nBonjean:Yeah, no, that's a great question. And also on the Medicaid cuts, there are a lot of constituents in red states that could be affected by those, too. It's really difficult to say because, if you're going to put, you know, $550 billion, or some of that of clean energy tax credits back in, you're going to have House Republicans have a real problem with that.\nRight now, we've got four Senate Republicans that really publicly pose a total repeal of the credits: Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, John Curtis and Jerry Moran. So it's going to be interesting to see how this all shakes out.\nInskeep:Yeah, and four, we should note, is enough since you've got 53 Republicans, four is enough to sink something. Can I ask what you think happened to higher taxes on the rich, given that the president is said to be driving this, it's said to be his agenda. And he said he liked the idea of raising some taxes on the rich. And the House bill didn't include that.\nBonjean:Yeah, I didn't see that as a possibility. I just don't see [Republicans] raising the rates on the wealthy. That was something that Trump did propose and he proposed a new bracket too, and those making $2.5 million or over, I think that's who he considers really rich would then be hit with a tax cut, but that didn't really fly in the House and I think it falls countercurrent to what Republicans wanted to see.\nInskeep:One other thing, Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa got in some trouble or at least was criticized at a town hall meeting when she was told that Medicaid cuts would cause people to die. And she said, well, people are going to die. She then apologized in a way that wasn't really an apology, saying, obviously people die. She did this in a social media post from a cemetery. Is this helpful to Republicans?\nBonjean:I mean, it is factually true. We are all going to die.\nInskeep:Fact check: True! Go on.\nBonjean:Right. I don't know if that was the most artful answer given, you know, in a situation like this. But, you know, man, it's hard to explain an answer like that.",

On Friday, PBS — led by Paula Kerger (right) — and Lakeland PBS of Minnesota sued.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images, Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption\nPBS and a public television station in rural Minnesota filed suit on Friday against President Trump over his executive order demanding that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting kill all funding for the network.\nThe suit allegesTrump's orderis unlawful, exceeding his authority as president and violating Constitutional protections of free speech because he has made clear he doesn't like PBS's news coverage and programming.\n\"This action challenges an unprecedented presidential directive attacking PBS and its member stations… in a manner that will upend public television,\" the lawsuit states.\nIt continues: \"The EO makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech. That is blatant viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of PBS and PBS Member Stations' private editorial discretion.\"\nPBS President and CEO Paula Kerger declined comment Friday.\nIn a statement, the network said, \"After careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television's editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\"\nThe Minnesota station echoed PBS' logic, saying it joined the lawsuit \"to underscore the dire consequences on local member stations and our programming.\"\nIn response, the White House said CPB is \"creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.\"\n\"Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. \"The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\"\nTrump's executive order accuses NPR and PBS of failing to provide \"fair, accurate, unbiased and nonpartisan news.\" He asserts that there are plenty of media options for people to choose from nowadays.\n\"Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence,\" the order states.It bans CPB from sending any money to PBS and NPR, and bars local stations from sending the networks any federal money.\nOn social media platforms, Trump hasblastedthe networks in capital letters: \"REPUBLICANS MUST DEFUND AND TOTALLY DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM NPR & PBS, THE RADICAL LEFT 'MONSTERS' THAT SO BADLY HURT OUR COUNTRY!\"\nThe two networks reject that characterization.\nBeyond that, the lawsuit filed by PBS and Minnesota affiliate Lakeland PBS argues, \"regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\"\nPBS' legal action follows parallel litigation filed on Tuesday by NPR and three Colorado public radio stations against the Trump administration on the same grounds.\nThe public television court filings say PBS would lose $81 million per year in federal grants and \"a substantial portion\" of the $227 million that public TV stations pay it in order to run programs that range from children's shows to Ken Burns documentaries. A day after Trump issued his order, the U.S. Education Department cancelleda grant to CPBand PBS that paid for a major educational initiative - about $31 million annually.\nLakeland PBS, serves a region in Northern and central Minnesota that includes some of the state's poorest counties and several tribal reservations. The station offers the only nightly television news program covering the region and offers curricular videos, lesson plans and other resources for local educators, according to the lawsuit.\nWhile PBS member stations receive, on average, about 15% of funding directly from CPB, Lakeland PBS relies on federal grants from CPB for 37% of its annual revenues. It says that all of the money it pays PBS for programming and other services comes from those federal funds.\nPBS shows make up more than half of Lakeland PBS's lineup.\nThe lawsuit contends that Lakeland PBS does not have enough unrestricted funds simply to shift other money over to pay for the cost of PBS programs. And it says that financial support from local companies is declining, not increasing. Locally based philanthropic money has been hard to come by.\n\"Lakeland PBS cannot readily or affordably replace such content and services,\" the lawsuit states. \"The EO's indirect funding bar thus poses an existential threat to Lakeland PBS, the only local source of television programming for hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans.\"\nThe suit was filed by Akin Gump Strauss, a major Washington-based law firm.\nTrump's order, issued on May 1st, has been rejected by the board of the privately incorporated CPB, through which federal money allocated by Congress flows to public broadcasters, primarily local stations. CPB has not adopted the president's decree. It is suing him over another executive orderpurporting to fire three of its five members.\nLike the NPR and PBS lawsuits, CPB's suit points to protections written into law by Congress safeguarding CPB and public broadcasters from political pressure applied by federal officials. They argue that includes the president.\nAccording to House Speaker Mike Johnson and other lawmakers, Trump is intending to send a formal request to Congress in early June to rescind the $1.1 billion it has allocated for public broadcasting for the next two years.\nThat spending was approved by the Republican-led U.S. House and Senate earlier this year and signed into law by Trump. It's unclear when the House and Senate will take up the measure, but Johnson recently mentioned the rescissions package as part of a focus on enacting more spending cuts. He vowed to \"act quickly.\"\nCongress would have 45 days to approve the rescission request, once received, for it to take effect.\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR Media Correspondent David Folkenflik with contributions from NPR Congressional Correspondent Deirdre Walsh.

(The agency is separate and distinct from special counsels appointed by the Department of Justice, such as Robert Mueller or Jack Smith, who investigate sensitive cases.)\nAs NPRreported earlier this month, Jewish civil rights leaders have raised concerns about Ingrassia's ties to extremists, particularly in light of the administration's stated commitment to fighting antisemitism. The Trump Administration recently promoted Kingsley Wilson to the role of Pentagon press secretary over theobjection of the American Jewish Committee, which said Wilson was \"unfit\" for government service, because she shared \"antisemitic conspiracy theories lifted right out of the neo-Nazi playbook.\" The White House has justified the attempted deportation of international students and the withholding of billions of dollars in funding to universities as parts of a plan to combat antisemitic hate.\n\"Appointing someone to a senior administration role despite their documented support for antisemites seriously conflicts with and undermines ongoing efforts to combat antisemitism at this critical moment,\" the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement in response to Ingrassia's nomination.\nIn contrast to prior leaders of the Office of Special Counsel, who typically had years of legal experience, Ingrassia has only briefly worked as a lawyer. He graduated from Cornell Law School in 2022 and became a registered attorney in New York less than a year ago, in July 2024. He caught the eye of the president through his pro-Trump blog posts during the 2024 presidential campaign and joined the administration in January 2025.\n\"Paul is a highly respected attorney, writer, and Constitutional Scholar, who has done a tremendous job serving as my White House Liaison for Homeland Security,\" Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. \"Paul holds degrees from both Cornell Law School and Fordham University, where he majored in Mathematics and Economics, graduating near the top of his class. Congratulations Paul!\"\nIn response to NPR's inquiry regarding Ingrassia's ties to extremists, the White House said it stands by the nomination.\n\"Paul Ingrassia is a respected attorney who has served President Trump exceptionally well and will continue to do so as the next head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an emailed statement. \"The eleventh-hour smear campaign will not deter the President from supporting this nomination, and the administration continues to have full confidence in his ability to advance the President's agenda.\"\nIn recent years, Ingrassia worked on the legal team for Andrew Tate, the \"manosphere\" influencer and self-described \"misogynist\", who has facedallegations of rape and human traffickingin both the United Kingdom and Romania — charges Tate denies. According to theAnti-Defamation League, Tate has also promoted \"Holocaust revisionism\" and antisemitism, and uses \"Jew\" as an insult on social media.\nIngrassia has not only assisted in Tate's legal defense, but also praised him as an \"extraordinary man\" and \"the embodiment of the ancient ideal of excellence,\" who has been unjustly targeted by \"the global elites.\"\nUntil recently, Ingrassia's Instagram accountfeatured a pinned photoof him posing with Tate. (The photo remains on his Instagram account, but is no longer pinned to the top of his page.)\nIngrassia's ties to antisemitic extremists extend beyond Tate.\nIn June 2024, Ingrassia appeared in the crowd at an impromptu rally for Holocaust denier and white nationalist Nick Fuentes after Fuentes was ejected from a gathering of the young conservative group Turning Point USA.\nIngrassia condemned Turning Point for removing Fuentes from their conference, calling it an \"awful decision.\"\n\"Conservatives should always uphold the First Amendment and allow for dissident voices,\"Ingrassia postedon X.\nAt the Fuentes rally, supporters chanted \"down with Israel,\" and Fuentes told the crowd, \"calling Donald Trump a racist only makes me like him more.\"\nIngrassia also wrote aSubstack postcalling on X to remove its ban on Fuentes for promoting hate speech. (Fuentes' account was later restored.)\nIngrassia has also attended events supporting defendants charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, including a defendant with a history of extreme antisemitic and racist rhetoric who gave himself a \"Hitler mustache.\"\nIn response to NPR's questions earlier this month, Ingrassia said in an email, \"This narrative you're trying to attach to me that I'm some sort of extremist is lacking in all credibility.\"\nIngrassia claimed that he inadvertently attended Fuentes' rally.\n\"I had no knowledge of who organized the event, observed for 5-10 minutes, then left,\" he wrote to NPR. He did not address Fuentes' well-documented history of antisemitism and racism.\nIngrassia also avoided questions about Tate's antisemitic rhetoric. He did denounce the \"hateful or incendiary\" remarks of the Jan. 6 defendant, insisting \"my advocacy for J6ers is not based on any particular remark, but on the principle that all Americans are entitled to due process and free speech.\"\nSomeconservative commentatorshave alsocriticizedIngrassia's social media posts about Israel.\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing approximately 1,200 people,Ingrassia posted, \"I think we could all admit at this stage that Israel/Palestine, much like Ukraine before it, and BLM before that, and covid/vaccine before that, was yet another psyop.\" (The term \"psyop\" is short for \"psychological operation.\")\nDespite Ingrassia's extremist ties, Leo Terrell, the leader of the Trump administration's antisemitism task force, praised Ingrassia's nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel.\n\"Perfect Choice!\"Terrell wrote.\nTerrell himself hasfaced criticismfor sharing a social media post by a prominent white supremacist that said, \"Trump has the ability to revoke someone's Jew card.\"",

        "title": "Trump announces plan to double tariffs on imported steel to 50%",
        "content": "President Trump speaks during a visit to U.S. Steel - Irvin Works in West Mifflin, Pa., on Friday.Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nWEST MIFFLIN, Pa. — President Trump told a crowd at the U.S. Steel plant outside of Pittsburgh on Friday that he is doubling tariffs on imported steel, making the announcement as he celebrated a multibillion dollar deal between the iconic American steelmaker and the Japanese company Nippon Steel.\n\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" Trump said. \"Nobody's going to get around that.\"\nHe did not say when the increase would take effect.\nTrump made the announcement while touting the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon as a \"planned partnership\" and a major win for American manufacturing — even as the details of what's actually in the agreement remain far from clear.\nThe prospect of an agreement between the two steel giants has been a matter of debate for more than a year. Former President Joe Biden and then-candidate Trump both opposed the deal during the campaign. Biden later blocked the sale in January before he left office, citing concerns about national security.\nBut President Trump has changed his tune,announcing on his social media site Truth Sociallast week that the $14 billion deal will keep U.S. Steel in the U.S. and create \"at least 70,000 jobs.\"\nSpeaking outside of Pittsburgh on Friday, Trump promised there will be no U.S Steel layoffs as a result of the Nippon Steel deal and that all steel workers will receive a $5,000 bonus. He went on to say U.S. Steel \"will continue to be controlled by the USA.\"\n\"This is an incredible deal for American steel workers, and it includes vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs at all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving,\" Trump said. \"U.S. Steel will maintain all of its current operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of the next 10 years, and we have that as a commitment.\"\nAdditional details about what's in the deal have been sparse, though. Trump himself seemed to tell reporters last weekend that the deal wasn't final.\n\"You know we'll see what the final is, but they're going to invest billions of dollars in steel, and it's a good company, Nissan, it's a very good company, but we'll see,\" Trump told reporters, apparently mixing up the name of the company with the Japanese car company Nissan.\n\"But it's an investment and a partial ownership and it will be controlled by the USA,\" he said.\nThe United Steelworkers union said in a statement that it did not participate in discussions around the deal \"nor were we consulted.\"\n\"Whatever the deal structure, our primary concern remains with the impact that this merger of U.S. Steel into a foreign competitor will have on national security, our members and the communities where we live and work,\" the union said.\nThe White House did not respond to questions ahead of the event about the structure of the deal.\nU.S. Steelreleased a statementafter the deal was announced praising Trump for his leadership and committing to further investments in the U.S. But the company has not filed any forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor has it released any details about the agreement.\n\"U. S. Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,\" the statement read.\nAndrew Fulton, a spokesman for U.S. Steel, said he was unable to provide any further information when reached for comment on Thursday.\nThat has left market analysts who advise investors to speculate. Several industry specialists told NPR they were skeptical that the agreement was substantially different from a structure proposed by Nippon Steel in 2024 for the acquisition of U.S. Steel.\n\"No matter how the government and or the non-answers from U.S. Steel want to position this, this is an acquisition,\" said Gordon Johnson, CEO of GLJ research. \"It's very clearly an acquisition.\"\nOthers speculated that the discussion of a partnership may be a way to obscure Trump's reversal on the plan. Phil Gibs at Key Bank Capitol Markets said the vague statements seem to be intentional.\n\"It has to be purposely opaque because there have been so many missteps, misfires, lawsuits, political interference and then we finally get to what looks to a conclusion and we're even questioning the conclusion,\" he said.\nThis is one of Trump's first domestic trips since returning to office and it is no mistake that he is heading to Pennsylvania. The state helped deliver him the presidency in 2024 and remains a critical state for Republicans as they prepare for the midterm elections next year.\nThe trip also provides the president an opportunity to underscore a major theme of the first few months of his second term: bringing foreign investment to the U.S. through onshoring manufacturing.\nBut the murky details of the agreement may complicate his victory lap. The United Steel Workers unionreleased a statement this weekquestioning the deal.\n\"At this time, we cannot say whether the 'planned partnership' described in Friday's message on Truth Social or news reports since then represents any meaningful change from the merger proposed in 2023, under which Nippon Steel would acquire U.S. Steel and make it a wholly owned subsidiary,\" the statement said. \"Our core concerns about Nippon Steel — a foreign-owned corporation with a documented history of violating U.S. trade laws — remain as strong and valid today as ever, and that is so whether U.S. Steel and Nippon adhere to the same deal that they have pursued since December 2023 or whether they tweak the terms to satisfy concerns in Washington.\"\nDemocratic politicians from the state, including Gov. Josh Shapiro, are offering very tentative statements. Speaking to reporters at an event on Tuesday, Shapiro offered a cautious take.\n\"I'm cautiously optimistic today, after the President's statement last week,\" he said. \"There's still no deal signed, and there's still a lot of work that needs to be done.\"\nPoliticians and analysts all said they'll be watching the president's trip, looking for some clues about the details.",

        "content": "A federal court blocked President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imports this week, but the administration has promised to appeal.  The on-again-off-again import taxes have been a source of frustration for many businesses that don't know what their costs will be from day to day.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nMany American small-business owners have been riding a rollercoaster of tariff-related feelings: worry, confusion, anxiety, frustration.\nThis week, there are new emotions.\n\"I feel a lot of relief and hope,\" says Sarah Wells, whose Virginia company sells breast-pump backpacks and other maternity accessories. In March, she had to find an extra $15,000 to receive her shipment from China – the last for now – whichwas traveling to the U.S. when the White House first raised tariffs.\nNow that two federal courts have ruled that President Trumphad overstepped his authorityin ordering the tariffs, Wells ponders the same question most of her peers are asking: Will they get that money back?\nBut also, as the White House vows to appeal, there's the perennial other thought: Is this simply the latest curve on the tariff rollercoaster?\nBarton O'Brien prepared for tariffs by stockpiling every space he had with leashes, harnesses and other pet supplies that he sells at hundreds of stores.\n\"We had dog life jackets in the bathroom,\" says O'Brien, a former Marine who now runs BAYDOG from Kent Island in Maryland. \"Our warehouse was bursting. We had to rent a container and put it out back.\"\nBarton O'Brien, shown with his dog Walter, runs the BAYDOG company, which sells harnesses, life-jackets and other pet supplies. He imports products from China, India and Vietnam, and double-digit tariffs have been challenging for his business.Barton O'Brienhide caption\nNow, he's been watching several businesses sue the Trump administration over tariffs after canceling some of his own orders for doggie sweaters.\nHe'd prepared for double-digit tariffs on China, but not on his shipments from suppliers in India and Vietnam. A threatened 26% tax on imports from India would have more than eclipsed his profit margin, so O'Brien canceled orders for much of what he planned to sell this fall. And for items he will sell next year? He's gambling the tariffs will be lower in the months to come – maybe thanks to the Supreme Court taking up the tariff case.\n\"The production cycle is very long. So you need to plan things six months, eight months out,\" O'Brien says. \"We don't know what the tariff regime is going to be, but we have to at least get them made and then hopefully we get a favorable decision.\"\nLate Wednesday, the U.S. Court of International Tradestruck down many of Trump's tariffs, ruling in favor of 12 states and five businesses. The following day, a U.S. appeals court temporarily put that judgment on hold until the legal proceedings play out.\nAlso on Thursday, a second federal court blocked Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, ruling in favor of two Illinois toy importers.\nThe White House has promised an appeal, defending its use of the 1977 law called the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\"We expect to fight this battle all the way to the Supreme Court,\" said spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.\nIn the meantime, businesses are left in the murky waters — hesitant to make more or ship more, unsure where to build factories or how high to raise prices.\n\"I'm not planning to do anything right now,\" says Rozalynn Goodwin from South Carolina, who sells patented double-snap hair barrettes called GaBBY Bows, made in China. \"I don't trust what's going on right now, I just don't.\"\nGoodwin isat a crossroads: Her firm had won a dream deal to supply GaBBY Bows to hundreds of Claire's stores. But at one point, tariffs on her products stacked up to more than 170%. When the White House agreed in mid-May totemporarily lower tariffson Chinese goods, Goodwin's tariff bill fell to roughly 35% — still unaffordable for her business.\n\"When you're selling a product that is $3.99, every cent counts,\" Goodwin says. \"Every cent.\"\nShe's had to renegotiate the deal with Claire's. Instead of new designs and colors, they'll start with the barrettes Goodwin already has in the country. She's continued looking for U.S.-based manufacturers, but their prices remain too high. What will she do when her inventory runs out?\n\"I am hopeful that by the fall, you know, cooler heads are at work, and we can get to some type of resolution,\" Goodwin says. \"I'm going to make what we have work. Until I cannot make it work anymore.\"\nEven if new court rulings ultimately stand and abolish Trump's tariffs under the emergency law, the White House has other legal authorities to set import taxes. But they would likely be more limited in their scale than the worldwide tariffs targeted by this week's rulings. For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the president to impose tariffs to address national security threats, and Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act allows import taxes to punish trade violations. Trump has used both powers in the past to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and goods from China.\nSarah Wells, whose Sarah Wells Bags sells totes and breast milk coolers, has raised prices by 10% to 15% to offset some of her tariff expenses.\nShe is one of many business owners that have done so. This week, cosmetics company e.l.f. said it's raisingall of its prices by $1because of tariffs. Trumplashed out at Walmartearlier this month after the superstore warned oftariff-induced price increases.\n\"I have just been squeezed from all ends,\" Wells says. \"The cost of shipping has gone up. The cost of boxes has gone up, shipping labels.\"\nLast month, when tariffs on goods from China spiked to 145%, importers rushed to stash cargo in bonded U.S. warehouses, where they could temporarily avoid the levies. Then, when the 90-day truce dropped those tariffs to 30%, those same businesses raced to get their cargo out of warehouses and paid extra to ship additional goods.\nWells had found a new manufacturer in Cambodia as a backup for China. But the Cambodian shipments will take time and likely won't come until early 2026. So she's watching the tariff lawsuits like a hawk, to decide whether to resume ordering from her China suppliers.\n\"Until we get a little more clarity, the ultimate irony is we're not going to see companies rushing to do much of anything, in terms of reshoring to the U.S. or moving out of China,\" says Marc Busch, a trade law expert at Georgetown University. \"No one knows what could be next. It could change in a heartbeat and that really is the big problem today.\"\nThat same uncertainty hasrattled financial markets. Stocks have tumbled each time the president orders new tariffs, only to rebound when Trump backs off. The markets' reaction to this week's court rulings has been muted — as investors try to assess the legal and political road ahead.",

Santiago/Getty Imageshide caption\nBack in early March, Massachusetts Agriculture Commissioner Ashley Randlesent a letterto the new U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, voicing congratulations — and a number of concerns.\nRandle, a fifth-generation dairy farmer, shared that USDA's freeze on grants — imposed before Rollins was sworn in — had left Massachusetts farmers in limbo, wondering if they'd ever be reimbursed for investments they'd made based on those grants.\nShe also sounded the alarm on positions that had been cut.\n\"The loss of USDA staff has also left Massachusetts farmers without essential resources that have long been an important part of their success,\" Randle wrote, pointing to diminished staffing at the local Farm Service Agency office, which helps with loans, insurance and disaster relief.\nOutside groups sued; a court order later required USDA to reinstate fired employees. But since then, the Trump administration has moved swiftly to \"reorient the department to be more effective and efficient at serving the American people,\" according to a USDA spokesperson.\nAs part of the overhaul, USDA allowedmore than 15,000 employees— close to 15% of its workforce —to resign with pay and benefits through September.\nThose departures have led to new concerns for Randle, including whether the federal government will be able to respond quickly in a crisis. She's been told that many of USDA's Area Veterinarians in Charge, who get the first call whenever a pest or disease is detected on a farm, have resigned, including the one assigned to New England.\nWith avian flu likely to return with the fall bird migration, and other diseases including New World screwworm and African swine fever creeping ever closer to the U.S., Randle knows U.S. farmers and ranchers, along with the U.S. food supply, could be at risk.\n\"Being able to be nimble and respond as quickly as possible in these types of incidents is incredibly important,\" she told NPR. \"It could be challenging.\"\nChickens stand in a henhouse at Sunrise Farms on Feb. 18 in Petaluma, Calif.

He retired in January after helping with the presidential transition.\nKevin Shea spent 45 years at the USDA, most of that time at APHIS. He retired in January after helping with the presidential transition.Ryan Gary/The Sunroomhide caption\nShea notes that over the years, APHIS employees have worked to successfully eradicate or keep at bay pests such as the boll weevil, a beetle that feeds on cotton buds, and New World screwworm, a parasite that burrows into the open wounds of animals. It's recently resurfaced in Mexico.\nHe fears that progress could now be lost, with animal health technicians, epidemiologists, entomologists, wildlife biologists and many who supported them gone.\n\"It'll be very hard to ever rebuild the animal health workforce and the plant health workforce because they've taken away so much of what made government service attractive to those people — stability, security and a sense of public mission,\" Shea says.\nHe points to disparaging comments made by the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who once said he wanted government bureaucrats to be \"traumatically affected,\" to the point where they wouldn't want to go to work.\n\"When they use rhetoric like that, why would you work for the government if you had another choice?\" says Shea.\nGiven the depletion of key staff at APHIS, Shea presumes there was a lack of understanding among the new political leadership of what the agency does. He also presumes the Trump administration outsourced the reduction of the workforce to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, \"who I'm sure have no idea,\" he says.\nWhat he would want them to know is that American agriculture has been relatively free of pests and disease in recent decades thanks in large part to the work of APHIS. And that, in turn, has given the U.S. two important things: a trade advantage in relation to the rest of the world and an abundant, cheap supply of food.\nIt's easy to imagine what it would look like if the U.S. were to lose significant ground on this front. Outbreaks of avian influenza in 2025 alone have resulted in the culling of more than 30 million hens,according to USDA, sendingegg prices soaring. Citrus greening disease, caused by a tiny sap-sucking insect from Asia, has already wiped out much of Florida's orange crop.\n\"We're trying to save California,\" Shea says. \"If we don't have a fully functioning APHIS, that's at risk.\"\nAnd now there are concerns that New World screwworm, detected 700 miles away in Mexico, or African swine fever, now endemic in the Dominican Republic, could make their way into the U.S. and cause deadly damage to livestock.\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and President Trump attend an event in the East Room of the White House on May 22 in Washington, D.C.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Imageshide caption\nOn May 11, Rollins suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison across the southern border to combat the spread of screwworm. Then on Tuesday,she announced a new $21 million investmentto fight screwworm in Mexico.\n\"The investment I am announcing today is one of many efforts my team is making around the clock to protect our animals, our farm economy, and the security of our nation's food supply,\" Rollins said in a statement.\nIn South Dakota, state veterinarian Beth Thompson acknowledges that there are always ways to streamline processes and make things more efficient.\nStill, she worries about the sheer number of experienced veterinarians, technicians and others who have walked out the door in the span of a few short months.\n\"I'm really hoping that folks have captured what those people with that history and wisdom and knowledge knew,\" she says.\nThompson has heard from her APHIS contacts that imports and exports and disease response will remain priorities. A USDA spokesperson has said that Rollins will not compromise the department's critical work. But with Trump's determination to shrink the government, Thompson assumes some programs and services will be scaled back.\nShe says APHIS leaders will probably need to assess whether there are diseases they can stop surveilling and devoting resources to, such as scrapie, a fatal, degenerative disease that attacks the central nervous systems of sheep and goats.\n\"We're really, really close to eradicating that disease,\" says Thompson. \"I think that once we get through the next couple of years with that disease, that program can probably step back.\"\nAt the moment, with employees being shifted around, she says she's still waiting to see what the impact will be.\n\"I don't think we have the final picture in place of how USDA is going to be changed and what that means for the individual farmer or rancher,\" she says.\nThe USDA spokesperson noted that Rollins hadlifted the hiring freezeon more than 50 positions \"critical to the safety and security of the American people, our National forests, the inspection and safety of the Nation's agriculture and food supply system.\"\nShea questions why they let so many people go in the first place.\n\"It was just a completely backwards way of doing business,\" he says. \"And now they're trying to backtrack that and try to figure out, gee, these are some things we really should not have done.\"\nIn Massachusetts,Randle does believe Rollins is listening to concerns she and others have raised. She's hopeful the USDA will take a more surgical approach moving forward, especially given all the other challenges farmers are facing, from climate change to access to labor to trade uncertainties.\n\"To come in and further disrupt the services and resources that farms could access, I think was really unfortunate,\" says Randle. \"I hope it has given some pause to the administration, to be able to look back and ask, how can we best serve our farmers and our food system stakeholders to make sure they are viable going forward?\"",

While Trump and others have touted Musk as the leader of DOGE's restructuring efforts, lawyers for the government have insisted the billionaire has no legal authority and have downplayed his efforts.\nThis week, a federal judge allowed a casechallenging Musk and DOGE's authoritywithin the federal government to continue, and several others are still pending.\nBut many of Musk's allies are embedded across federal agencies as full-time employees, like a group of young staffers based in the General Services Administrationwho have been attempting to push DOGE's reach beyond the executive branch— in some cases trying to embed in non-governmental and non-executive branch entities.\nOther lawsuits have focused on one area DOGE has seen great success in:amassing sensitive government dataand combining it into massive databases. Multiple federal judges have raised concerns about DOGE's data access and what they plan to do with it. In some cases, it appears DOGE and the Trump administration are using the data for immigration enforcement purposes.\nBefore joining the second Trump administration, Musk had a lofty goal of slashing $2 trillion from the federal budget. Earlier this year, Musk famously took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference, wielding a chainsaw to illustrate his push to cut spending.  But his target number was revised downward multiple times, eventually landing at around $150 billion he claimed would be saved by the end of the fiscal year in September.\nNPR's reporting has repeatedly found DOGE'ssavings claims to be overstated, inaccurateand rooted in afundamental misunderstandingof how the federal budget works.\nThis week, Musk expressed displeasure at Trump's so-called \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" of priorities that passed the House. In aninterview with CBS, he said the measure's projected addition to the deficit and debt \"undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\" Beyond the budget, some of the other signature DOGE efforts have been reversed orheld up by the courts, like thepush to fire federal workersand close agencies. Some of the lawsuits have used Musk's public statements and social media posts to argue those changes broke the law.\nMusk's push for a mandate that federal employees should send short emails listing weekly accomplishments was overruled by some Cabinet heads and was one of several ways his Silicon Valley background clashed with the ways of Washington.\nReporting from NPR and other outlets has highlighted numerous examples of DOGE-led changes that have likely made the government less efficient. That includes things like:the elimination of a tech unit inside GSAthat helped improve digital services across agencies; encouraging a return-to-office push withshortages of desks, internet access and even toilet paper;spending freezes on government payment cardsthat disrupted workers' ability to buy basic supplies and more.\nThe special government employee designation gives Musk an exit from government that elected politicians do not easily have. Musk will return to his multiple companies at a time when his business empire has seen financial setbacks, especially at Tesla, his main source of wealth.\nAs Musk's DOGE work ramped up, Tesla owners sold their cars, storefronts were vandalized and profits dropped as some reports suggested the automaker's board was looking to replace Musk.\nMusk has already pivoted more of his prolific posting on his social media site X to Tesla, SpaceX and Starlink — though not beforeannouncing his departurefrom the federal government by promising DOGE would only grow stronger \"as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"\nAnd after spending hundreds of millions of dollars to support Trump's reelection, and an unsuccessful push to influence a Wisconsin state Supreme Court race, Musk announced last week that he wouldslow down his political spending.\n\"I'm going to do a lot less in the future,\" he said in a video interview with Bloomberg News at the Qatar Economic Forum. \"I think I've done enough.\"\nNPR's Bobby Allyn contributed reporting.\nHave information you want to share about the future of DOGE or Elon Musk?

Kennedy Jr., which decried America's food supply, pesticides and prescription drugs.\nKennedy's wide-ranging \"Make America Healthy Again\" report, released last week, cited hundreds of studies, but acloser look by the news organization NOTUSfound that some of those studies did not actually exist.\nAsked about the report's problems, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the report will be updated.\n\"I understand there was some formatting issues with the MAHA report that are being addressed and the report will be updated.\" Leavitt told reporters during her briefing. \"But it does not negate the substance of the report, which, as you know, is one of the most transformative health reports that has ever been released by the federal government.\nKennedy has repeatedly said he would bring \"radical transparency\" and \"gold-standard\" science to the public health agencies. But the secretary refused to release details about who authored the 72-page report, which calls for increased scrutiny of the childhood vaccine schedule and describes the nation's children as overmedicated and undernourished.\nLeavitt said that the White House has \"complete confidence\" in Kennedy.\n\"Minor citation and formatting errors have been corrected,\" HHS Spokesman Andrew Nixon said in an emailed statement. He described the report as a \"historic and transformative assessment by the federal government to understand the chronic disease epidemic afflicting our nation's children.\"\nNOTUS reported Thursday that seven of the more than 500 studies cited in the report did not appear to have ever been published. An author of one study confirmed that while she conducted research on the topics of anxiety in children, she never authored the report listed. Some studies were also misinterpreted in the MAHA report. The problematic citations were on topics around children's screen time, medication use and anxiety.\nKennedy's MAHA report had already been stoking concerns among Trump loyalists, including farmers who criticized how the report characterized the chemicals sprayed on U.S. crops.\nThe report is supposed to be used to develop policy recommendations that will be released later this year. The White House has requested a $500 million boost in funding from Congress for Kennedy's MAHA initiative.",

        "content": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing on Thursday. The National Association of the Deaf is suing the White House to require American Sign Language interpreters to be present at briefings.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nThe National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a federal lawsuit against the White House over a lack of American Sign Language interpreters at media briefings.\nThe NAD says the White House abruptly stopped providing ASL interpreters during press briefings and other public events when President Trump returned to office for a second term.\nThe lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, asks the court to require ASL interpreters be present at these events and that video of them be available for viewers.\nASL is distinct from English, with its own vocabulary and grammar. The NAD says \"at least several hundred thousand\" people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people know little English. That's why the group says English closed captioning of briefings is not sufficient.\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and names President Trump, press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles as defendants, along with offices for the president and vice president. The suit alleges the White House is violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which is a cornerstone of federal disability rights law, as well as the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment.\n\"The White House's failure to provide qualified ASL interpreters during public briefings, press conferences, and related events is against the law,\" it reads. \"Federal law unequivocally prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities and requires them to have meaningful access to the federal government's programs and services. Failing to provide ASL interpreters deprives deaf people meaningful access to the White House's press briefings.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the lawsuit.\nTwo deaf men are joining NAD in the suit. Derrick Ford, 36, lives in Anderson, Ind. The complaint says ASL is Ford's primary language and that he's concerned about \"missing information about executive orders; diversity, equity, and inclusion ('DEI'); Social Security; Medicare, the economy; and issues impacting Americans in general.\" Ford has difficulty understanding English and closed captions.\nThe other man is Matthew Bonn, a 48-year-old resident of Germantown, Md., who attends Gallaudet University, a school in Washington, D.C., that uses ASL in the education of deaf and hard of hearing people. The lawsuit says Bonn also has trouble understanding closed captions and stopped watching White House press briefings in February because he couldn't understand them. The complaint says \"he wants information about the economy, Medicare and Medicaid changes, and executive orders on gender issues.\"\nThe NAD says the White House ignored its repeated requests, including alettersent to Wiles in January. According to the group, more than 48 million deaf or hard of hearing people live in the U.S.\n\"Deaf and hard of hearing Americans have the right to the same access to White House information as everyone else,\" said Bobbie Beth Scoggins, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the NAD, in a statement. \"Such information must be provided not only through captioning but also in American Sign Language.\"\nThis isn't the first time the group has sued the government over ASL. In 2020, the organization took the first Trump White House to federal court at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In that case,a federal judge orderedthe White House to provide a qualified interpreter for all coronavirus briefings. After the order, the White House began providing ASL for pandemic-related briefings.\nIn 2021, under the Biden administration, the White House startedincluding ASL interpreters for all press briefingsand the following year hired the White House'sfirst full-time interpreters. The NAD says that at the time, interpreters were visible on all White House official communication channels.\nIn his first day back in office, Trump signed anexecutive ordereliminating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) programs and activities from the federal government.",

His last surviving grandchild, Harrison Ruffin Tyler, died on Sunday.Hulton Archive/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe last living grandson of President John Tyler — who left the White House in 1845 — has died.\nHarrison Ruffin Tyler died Sunday at 96, according to Annique Dunning, executive director ofSherwood Forest, the Virginia property that members of the Tyler family have called home since the end of its patriarch's presidency. Tyler had suffered strokes in recent years and died of natural causes, she said.\nTyler led a successful career as a chemical engineer before turning his attention — and newfound wealth — to preserving historical sites.\n\"His love of history and his birthplace, Charles City County, VA, led him to preserve both Sherwood Forest, President Tyler's home, and Fort Pocahontas, a Civil War fortification nearby,\" Dunning told NPR over email. \"He will be remembered for his considerable charm, generosity and unfailing good humor by all who knew him.\"\nIn interviews over the years, Tyler said he didn't pay much attention to his lineage when he was younger.\n\"I grew up during World War II, and surviving the war and the shortages was what was on everybody's mind,\" he toldSubaru Drive Magazinein 2002. \"Being related to a president was never a thought.\"\nAs he got older, however, it became a great source of pride — and amusement.\n\"When you talk about my grandfather born in the 1700s, there is a disconnect there,\" he told a Richmond CBS affiliatein 2012, during a wave of media coverage. \"It is somewhat incredulous because of the time frame.\"\nJohn Tyler was the 10th president of the U.S., and the first vice president to ascend to the presidency.\nHe took office in 1841 after William Henry Harrisondied just a monthinto his term. Tyler'sfour years in officewere largely defined by his opposition to his own Whig Party, his controversial annexation of Texas and staunch support of states' rights — and, later, the Confederacy.\nTyler had eight children with hisfirst wife, Letitia, who died of a stroke in 1842. Two years later, he married Julia Gardiner, a New York socialite 30 years his junior.\nWhile Gardiner initially turned down his advances, she \"literally swooned into President Tyler's arms after witnessing her father's death in an explosion,\" according to theNational First Ladies Library & Museum. They had been cruising the Potomac River on a new naval warship when agun exploded, killing six people, including cabinet secretaries and Gardiner's father.\nAn engraved portrait of First Lady Julia Gardiner Tyler. She and President Tyler had seven children together, one of whom was Harrison Ruffin Tyler's father.Kean Collection/Getty Imageshide caption\nAt the end of his term, Tyler and Gardiner moved from the White House to Sherwood Forest, about 27 miles southeast of Richmond. They had a total ofseven childrenbefore his death at age 71 in 1862.\nTheir third-youngest, Lyon Gardiner Tyler, was born in 1853 — when his dad was 63. After the death of his first wife, Lyon Gardiner Tyler went on to marry Sue Ruffin, who was 35 years his junior and had her own notable family history: She was adirect descendantof Pocahontas andEdmund Ruffin, aprominent planter, Virginia state senator and early advocate for secession.\nHarrison Ruffin Tyler — their second son — was born in 1928. His dadwas 75at the time.\nTyler showed promise in mathematics from a young age. At 16, he won a scholarship to the College of William & Mary, where his dad had served as president.\nDespite Tyler's prominent family heritage, he had a modest upbringing. His son, William, told theWashington Postin 2020, because the late president's wealth was spread thin among his numerous heirs, and most of Tyler's father's wealth was \"tied up in a vast book collection\" that he donated to William & Mary. His college tuition was mysteriously paid by Lady Astor, whom the family had never met.\nTyler graduated with a chemistry degree in 1949, then studied chemical engineeringat Virginia Tech. In 1968 he co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company whose clients eventually included Kraft Foods, Philip Morris and the Ford Motor Company. It boasted revenues of $200 million in the fiscal year beforeit was acquiredby Danaher Corporation in 2007.\nTyler toldVirginia Tech Magazinein 2007 that he and co-founder William Simmons had three goals: \"sell a product that works, hire good employees, and take care of those employees.\" They made the company an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) in 1989, and their employees gained controlling interest when they retired in 2000.\nTyler's \"accomplishments in business changed the lives of countless employees of ChemTreat,\" Dunning told NPR.\nEngraved view of Sherwood Forest, the home of President John Tyler, in Charles City County, Va., circa 1845.Kean Collection/Getty Imageshide caption\nTyler and his wife, Francis Payne Bouknight Tyler, acquired Sherwood Forest from cousins in 1975, according to Dunning. By that point it was a \"shadow of its former self,\" according toa databasefrom the American Aristocracy website.\nThe president's widow, Julia, fled the property during the Civil War and returned afterward to find it ransacked by Union troops and formerly enslaved people, including some theTyler family had owned. There were 43 enslaved workers on the property as of 1860, according to Sherwood Forest.\nAfter acquiring it in the 1970s, Tyler and his wife set about restoring the 50-acre property (about half of which is open forpublic tours), referring to letters and books his grandmother had used to decorate it originally. Sherwood Forest, which is now anational historic landmark, boasts the longest frame house in America, as well as a ghost named theGray Lady.\nIn 1996, Tyler purchasedFort Pocahontas, a Civil War fortification a few miles from Sherwood Forest. The National Register of Historic Placessays the sitewas \"virtually untouched\" for over a century until Tyler bought it. It opens to the publicfor a reenactmentone weekend every June.\n\"Due to his vision, dedication, and generous support, efforts to preserve and interpret the fort continue today through Fort Pocahontas LTD, a private foundation of the Tyler family,\" it added.\nTyler and his wife alsodonated $5 millionto establish an endowment for the College of William & Mary's history department in 2001, in memory of his father. But, citing \"Lyon Gardiner Tyler's views on the Confederacy and on slavery,\" thedepartment was renamedin honor of Tyler himself in 2021.\nIt says his donation underwrites research and guest lectures on a wide range of subjects, including Jewish history, imperialism, the Cold War and the histories of slavery, racism and discrimination.\n\"The extraordinary generosity of Harrison Ruffin Tyler — whose gift came with no limitations on the scholarly activity it would make possible — continues to bear good fruit,\" the department says.\nTyler acknowledged his grandfather's complicated legacy, but also defended it. He said in a2012 interviewthat Tyler is not often recognized for organizing a Peace Conference in Washington in 1861 to try to avert a civil war. When that effort failed, he was elected to the Confederate Congress but died before his term began.\n\"He was not a traitor to his country,\" he separately told WTVR, the CBS station, that year. \"John Tyler did try to promote peace wherever he could.\"\nHe laughed off the idea of following in his family's tradition of fathering children later in life, saying, \"We're not going that route again.\"\nTyler's wife, Frances Payne Bouknight Tyler,died in 2019. His brother, Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr.,died in 2020, making him the president's last surviving grandson.\nHarrison Ruffin Tyler is survived by three children and eight grandchildren, according to Dunning, who says Sherwood Forest will remain in the family.\n\"Sherwood Forest is a private foundation of the Tyler family,\" she said. \"Nothing will be changing about that.\"",

        "content": "People walk past Hungary's parliament building in Budapest in May.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nBUDAPEST, Hungary — This capital city doesn't have the trappings of an autocracy.\nThere are no tanks on the streets or intelligence agents stamping out whispers of dissent. While strolling through the streets it's easy to be captivated by the blend of architectural styles, the sprawling public transportation system and the vibrant cafe and restaurant scene where tourists sip wine under twinkling lights.\nIt's easy to miss what critics say lurks just beneath the surface.\n\"Budapest is a gorgeous city and you will never have any clue that this is really a dictatorship,\" says Kim Scheppele, who teaches sociology and international affairs at Princeton and worked in Hungary for years researching the Hungarian Constitutional Court.\nSince the election of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in 2010 this once robust democracy that emerged from Soviet Communism in the 1990s has regressed into what members of the European Parliament now call an electoral autocracy, a hybrid political system that injects authoritarian methods into what appear to be democratic institutions and structures.\nOrbán remade the courts through a series of reforms that critics say replaced experienced judges with younger more malleable figures.  He's used state resources to financially starve independent press, changed the constitution to consolidate his power and passed laws and amendments to stifle civil society and minority groups, the latest an effective ban on pride celebrations, while fostering a culture of corruption that benefits a small clique of wealthy oligarchs. The moves have made Hungary somewhat of a pariah in the European Union.\nYet, the leader of this small central European country has captured the imagination of many U.S. conservatives who hold Orbán's rule up as a model for conservative populist leadership in liberal Western democracies.\nBuildings overlooking the Danube River in Budapest.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nThere is perhaps no greater symbol of that cross-cultural cooperation and admiration than the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering of conservative, populist and far right activists and politicians now converging on Budapest for a fourth consecutive year.\n\"For a long time in the West you had folks on the center right who, let's say, they made excuses,\" said David Reaboi, a right wing media personality who once lobbied on behalf of Orbán's government in the U.S.\nReaboi says the Hungarian leader's unapologetic style when it comes to cracking down on mass migration and what some regard as \"woke\" policies inspired American conservatives' now confrontational approach under President Donald Trump when it comes to immigration, minority rights, civil society and academia.\n\"They were afraid of media backlash or something,\" Reaboi said. \"Now I think what's the same about [the U.S. MAGA movement and Orbán's Hungary] is just this lack of fear of saying true things.\"\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán arrives at European Political Community summit in Skanderbeg Square in Tirana, Albania, on Friday, May 16, 2025.Leon Neal/Getty Pool/APhide caption\nReaboi bristles at Hungary being labeled a dictatorship. He calls the criticisms \"fringe insanity\" and adds that whatever one thinks about Orbán's policies and his party Fidesz he's \"been unbelievably successful in putting Budapest and Hungary itself on the map.\"\nOrbán's government has poured millions of dollars into creating that international presence through think tanks, like The Danube Institute.\nAt this research center that overlooks the river that divides Budapest, U.S. conservatives and nationalists have found an intellectual home inside Europe.\nThe government also funds the educational institution Mathius Corvinus Collegium which bills itself as an incubator for young talent in Hungary. Its critics see it as an incubator for future Fidesz-allied elites.\nFrom his top floor apartment in a historic building in Budapest, Boris Kálnoky, a prominent German journalist of Hungarian descent who heads the journalism school at MCC, says Orbán's presence on the western stage as a populist leader that's inspired U.S. conservatives was a \"conscious strategy.\"\n\"A thought process began here that we need to establish bridges towards the Anglo-Saxon conservative world,\" Kálnoky said.\nBoris Kálnoky, a prominent German journalist of Hungarian descent who heads the journalism school at Mathias Corvinus Collegegium.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nThe person who came up with this strategy to reach beyond Hungary's borders, was the head of MCC and the prime minister's political director, Balazs Orbán.\n\"He said, 'look to the left, they are globally allied.' They have their networks, they have conferences, they meet, and they have an ideology which unites them,\" Kálnoky said.\nSo Hungary began reaching out to other like-minded political groups including conservatives in the U.S. and inviting them to Budapest around 2014. They liked what they saw – a populist conservative government that was elected and re-elected using the resources of the state to support that goal.\nKálnoky said the pushback from the European Union against what it deems anti-democratic practices from the Fidesz party is its way of controlling a member state that won't fall in line with the majority.\nHe sees what critics point to as gerrymandering and taking control of the media and the courts as an elected party using its mandate to implement reforms and its program.  Hungary, he said, is not falling into autocracy.\n\"There is only one thing that is needed to separate Fidesz and Viktor Orbán from power, and that is that a relative majority of Hungarians vote for someone else than him,\" he said. \"That's all that's needed. And as long as that is the case, how can you speak of an autocracy?\"\nAutocracy or not, analysts like Scheppele, who was driven from Hungary as Orbán took control of the courts and higher education, are now warning that what came to pass in Hungary could come to be in the U.S.\nPolice watch protestors who are demonstrating against Orbán and his policies on Tuesday.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nHe started as a more liberal politician when he first won the office in 1998. But after being voted out he morphed into the populist conservative he is today.\n\"He hadn't looked particularly dangerous when he had been prime minister once before. But in his eight years out of power, he had spent that time planning a comeback,\" Scheppele said.  \"And he came into power with a very detailed plan to remake the Constitution and remake the entire legal system in such a way that he could never be removed from power again.\"\nIn the three years after he was elected in 2010, she said he transformed Hungary from a post-communist democratic success story to an autocracy.\nNow she said she recognizes the Orbán playbook in Project 2025, a blueprint for a Republican president written by a conservative think tank of Trump allies and loyalists, some of whom are now in the government. Trump's decisions in his first few months back in office mirror some of the decisions Orbán made in his early days back in power.\n\"The first thing [Orbán] did was to suspend the civil service law and fire huge numbers of public employees, particularly those in the public broadcast media, because they were the ones who, you know, were committed to truthful news,\" she said. \"And the second move was that he weaponized the state budget.\"\nHe weaponized it, she said, by starving dissent economically, cutting state advertising to neutral and opposition media and cancelling subsidies to non-profits that would oppose him. Orbán's party, Fidesz, controlling a two-thirds majority in the parliament, pushed through election laws that gerrymandered districts so that Fidesz could control more seats with fewer votes with each election.\nThe party also passed a series of other laws and constitutional amendments to consolidate power, including one that revoked the tax exempt status and privileges of more than 300 religious organizations. That law gutted their finances and forced them to move out of the country to survive economically. By the time the country's constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights weighed in and forced an amendment to the law, it was too late. The religious organizations that remained were consolidated under Orbán who now touts himself as the defender of Christian Europe.\nHe has proudly described himself as the leader of a Christian \"illiberal democracy\" fighting against the multiculturalism and pro- immigration stances of the liberal elite in the European Union.\nConstruction cranes can be seen in Budapest's castle district, along with the Hungarian flag.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nBut as President Trump and his supporters revel in his return to power, Orbán is facing his biggest political threat since taking office and consolidating power.\nThat threat emerged from inside his own party.  Peter Magyar, the husband of the former justice minister and a party loyalist, broke with Orbán to lead an opposition party that could very well win the election next year and break Orbán's control of the state.\n\"It's the first time in the last 15 years that you have a real chance to change the situation,\" said Bálint Magyar, a former education minister and a leading Hungarian sociologist at the Democracy Institute at Central European University.\nHe's fiercely critical of what he calls a criminal mafia style autocracy under Orbán that enriches and empowers the prime minister and his closest allies.\n\"The situation is now different with this emerging new movement,\" Magyar said.\nBálint Magyar, a former education minister and a leading Hungarian sociologist at the Democracy Institute at Central European University.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nIt's why he worries, as many Hungarians say they do, that somehow the government will find a way to stop Peter Magyar's party from running in the election next year.\nOrbán still has the support of many Hungarians though. That becomes more and more visible the farther you go outside the capital where Orbán's policies have brought construction projects to these rural areas. Those created jobs and brought new infrastructure, like hospitals. His funding model uses money from the European Union to bolster his party's interests as he accuses the EU of meddling in Hungary's domestic affairs.\nMeanwhile, the European Union is trying to pressure Orbán to reverse anti-democratic measures he's taken by withholding billions of dollars in grants allocated for Hungary's poorest regions. It's also been excluded from an EU-funded student exchange program with other European universities.\nAll of this weighs on the minds of young Hungarians charting their futures.\nAnd that's apparent as soon as you step into the classrooms at the Engame Academy in Budapest. It offers after school classes to students who are learning English and preparing to study abroad.\nPatrick Konigh teaches a sophmore class at Engame Academy in Budapest where they offer after school classes to students who are learning English and preparing to study abroad.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nRita Nadas is the head of education at the academy, which also does research on why Hungarian students choose to study abroad. In 2017, the main reason students went abroad was the quality of the universities and the quality of life that came with the degrees from higher education in other parts of Europe or the U.S. But that's changed now.\n\"These still are very important factors. But the most important factor that most students also chose in the study was politics in Hungary and life in Hungary in the public sphere,\" she said. \"So the push factor has also appeared as getting away from this political era.\"\nA political era that has grown more restrictive and less open, she said, under Orbán and one she senses might now feel somewhat familiar to Americans.\n\"We have been living in what you are living now since Trump for the past 15 years. Everything that is happening now in the U.S., we have been living it,\" she said. \"So we are talking about the Orbán government, which is methodically trying to stifle criticism. We experience it day by day. This means a very heavy centralization of education, the scrapping of the Ministry of Education. I think this sounds very familiar to you?\"\nRita Nadas, head of education at Engame Academy in Budapest.Claire Harbage/NPRhide caption\nShe doesn't see the Orbán model as one to emulate. Here, she said, she now lives with only the scaffolding of democracy.\n\"We can vote. Right? And there are no black cars pulling up outside at night like we used to have in the '50s,\" she said. \"Compared to that, this is a democracy. But what we would call a liberal democracy, it's very far from it.\"\nThe stifling of dissent shows up in subtle ways.\n\"It's having your favorite newspaper shut down,\" she said.\n\"It's seeing people being afraid to post online if they are working in the public sphere. It's my son asking me if it's OK for him to wear a girlie T-shirt or something in pink and then go outside.\" she said. \"What do I say?\"",

Could it worsen the spread of misleading or toxic content?\nUntil recently, what are known inside Meta as privacy and integrity reviews were conducted almost entirely by human evaluators.\nBut now, according to internal company documents obtained by NPR, up to 90% of all risk assessments will soon be automated.\nIn practice, this means things like critical updates to Meta's algorithms, new safety features and changes to how content is allowed to be shared across the company's platforms will be mostly approved by a system powered by artificial intelligence — no longer subject to scrutiny by staffers tasked with debating how a platform change could have unforeseen repercussions or be misused.\nInside Meta, the change is being viewed as a win for product developers, who will now be able to release app updates and features more quickly. But current and former Meta employees fear the new automation push comes at the cost of allowing AI to make tricky determinations about how Meta's apps could lead to real world harm.\n\"Insofar as this process functionally means more stuff launching faster, with less rigorous scrutiny and opposition, it means you're creating higher risks,\" said a former Meta executive who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the company. \"Negative externalities of product changes are less likely to be prevented before they start causing problems in the world.\"\nMeta said in a statement that it has invested billions of dollars to support user privacy.\nSince 2012, Meta has beenunder the watchof the Federal Trade Commission after the agency reached an agreement with the company over how it handles users' personal information. As a result, privacy reviews for products have been required, according to current and former Meta employees.\nIn its statement, Meta said the product risk review changes are intended to streamline decision-making, adding that \"human expertise\" is still being used for \"novel and complex issues,\" and that only \"low-risk decisions\" are being automated.\nBut internal documents reviewed by NPR show that Meta is considering automating reviews for sensitive areas including AI safety, youth risk and a category known as integrity that encompasses things like violent content and the spread of falsehoods.\nA slide describing the new process says product teams will now in most cases receive an \"instant decision\" after completing a questionnaire about the project. That AI-driven decision will identify risk areas and requirements to address them. Before launching, the product team has to verify it has met those requirements.\nMeta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at LlamaCon 2025, an AI developer conference, in Menlo Park, Calif., Tuesday, April 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)Jeff Chiu/AP/APhide caption\nUnder the prior system, product and feature updates could not be sent to billions of users until they received the blessing of risk assessors. Now, engineers building Meta products are empowered to make their own judgements about risks.\nIn some cases, including projects involving new risks or where a product team wants additional feedback, projects will be given a manual review by humans, the slide says, but it will not be by default, as it used to be. Now, the teams building products will make that call.\n\"Most product managers and engineers are not privacy experts and that is not the focus of their job. It's not what they are primarily evaluated on and it's not what they are incentivized to prioritize,\" said Zvika Krieger, who was director of responsible innovation at Meta until 2022. Product teams at Meta are evaluated on how quickly they launch products, among other metrics.\n\"In the past, some of these kinds of self-assessments have become box-checking exercises that miss significant risks,\" he added.\nKrieger said while there is room for improvement in streamlining reviews at Meta through automation, \"if you push that too far, inevitably the quality of review and the outcomes are going to suffer.\"\nMeta downplayed concerns that the new system will introduce problems into the world, pointing out that it is auditing the decisions the automated systems make for projects that are not assessed by humans.\nThe Meta documents suggest its users in the European Union could be somewhat insulated from these changes. An internal announcement says decision making and oversight for products and user data in the European Union will remain with Meta's European headquarters in Ireland. The EU has regulations governing online platforms, including theDigital Services Act, which requires companies including Meta to more strictly police their platforms and protect users from harmful content.\nSome of the changes to the product review process werefirst reportedby The Information, a tech news site. The internal documents seen by NPR show that employees were notified about the revamping not long after the companyended its fact-checking programand loosened its hate speech policies.\nTaken together, the changes reflect a new emphasis at Meta in favor of more unrestrained speech and more rapidly updating its apps — a dismantling of various guardrails the company has enacted over the years to curb the misuse of its platforms. The big shifts at the company also follow efforts by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to curry favor with President Trump, whose election victory Zuckerberg has called a \"cultural tipping point.\"\nAnother factor driving the changes to product reviews is a broader,years-long pushto tap AI to help the company move faster amid growing competition from TikTok, OpenAI, Snap and other tech companies.\nMeta said earlier this week it is relying more on AI to help enforce its content moderation policies.\n\"We are beginning to see [large language models] operating beyond that of human performance for select policy areas,\" the company wrote in its latestquarterly integrity report. It said it's also using those AI models to screen some posts that the company is \"highly confident\" don't break its rules.\n\"This frees up capacity for our reviewers allowing them to prioritize their expertise on content that's more likely to violate,\" Meta said.\nKatie Harbath, founder and CEO of the tech policy firm Anchor Change, who spent a decade working on public policy at Facebook, said using automated systems to flag potential risks could help cut down on duplicative efforts.\n\"If you want to move quickly and have high quality you're going to need to incorporate more AI, because humans can only do so much in a period of time,\" she said. But she added that those systems also need to have checks and balances from humans.\nAnother former Meta employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they also fear reprisal from the company, questioned whether moving faster on risk assessments is a good strategy for Meta.\n\"This almost seems self-defeating. Every time they launch a new product, there is so much scrutiny on it — and that scrutiny regularly finds issues the company should have taken more seriously,\" the former employee said.\nMichel Protti, Meta's chief privacy officer for product, said in a March post on its internal communications tool, Workplace, that the company is \"empowering product teams\" with the aim of \"evolving Meta's risk management processes.\"\nThe automation roll-out has been ramping up through April and May, said one current Meta employee familiar with product risk assessments who was not authorized to speak publicly about internal operations.\nProtti said automating risk reviews and giving product teams more say about the potential risks posed by product updates in 90% of cases is intended to \"simplify decision-making.\" But some insiders say that rosy summary of removing humans from the risk assessment process greatly downplays the problems the changes could cause.\n\"I think it's fairly irresponsible given the intention of why we exist,\" said the Meta employee close to the risk review process. \"We provide the human perspective of how things can go wrong.\"\nDo you have information about Meta's changes?

        "title": "Oil companies face a wrongful death suit tied to climate change",
        "content": "The sun begins to set beyond an oil refinery in California.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide caption\nA lawsuit filed in a Washington state court claims oil companies are responsible for the death of a woman in Seattle during a record-breaking heat wave several years ago.\nThe case marks the first time oil companies have been sued over the death of a person in a \"climate disaster,\" according to the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group.\nJulie Leon, 65, was found unresponsive in her car on June 28, 2021 — thehottest day in Seattle's history. The temperature in the city that day peaked at 108 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time Leon died of hyperthermia, her internal temperature had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit,according to the lawsuitfiled Thursday in King County Superior Court.\nThe suit names six oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron, that have allegedly known for decades that burning fossil fuels alters the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in more extreme weather and the \"foreseeable loss of human life.\" But rather than warn the public, the suit says the oil companies deceived consumers about the risks.\n\"Defendants have known for all of Julie's life that their affirmative misrepresentations and omissions would claim lives,\" the lawsuit says. \"Julie is a victim of Defendants' conduct.\"\nIna rapid attribution studyreleased days after the event, a team of scientists said the 2021 heatwave in the Pacific Northwest would have been \"virtually impossible without human-caused climate change.\"\nA lawyer for Chevron, Theodore Boutrous, criticized the lawsuit. \"Exploiting a personal tragedy to promote politicized climate tort litigation is contrary to law, science, and common sense,\" Boutrous said in a statement to NPR. \"The court should add this far-fetched claim to the growing list of meritless climate lawsuits that state and federal courts have already dismissed.\"\nRepresentatives of Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP and Phillips 66 declined to comment. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said a comment from the company wasn't immediately available.\nJulie Leon's daughter, Misti Leon, who filed the wrongful death lawsuit in Washington state, wants the oil companies to pay damages in amounts that would be determined at trial. Misti Leon is also trying to force the oil companies to conduct a public education campaign to correct \"decades of misinformation.\"\nFossil fuel companies alreadyface dozens of other climate lawsuitsfiled by states and localities for allegedly misleading the public for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of climate change. Those lawsuits seek money to help communities cope with the risks and damages from global warming, including more extreme storms, floods and heat waves. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has said repeatedly that the lawsuits are meritless and that climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by Congress, not the courts.\nThose kinds of lawsuits have had mixed results. A Pennsylvania judgerecently dismisseda climate lawsuit that Bucks County filed against several oil companies. Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr said the lawsuit was beyond the scope of state law. Since it was primarily about greenhouse gas emissions, he said it was a matter for the federal government to deal with under the Clean Air Act. Judge Corr noted that other courts have dismissed similar lawsuits by cities and states, including New Jersey and Baltimore.\nBoutrous, Chevron's lawyer in the Pennsylvania case, told WHYY that climate change is a \"policy issue that needs statewide, nationwide and global cooperation to resolve. These state lawsuits just don't really do anything other than clog the courts.\"\nOther cases, though, are moving forward. In January, the Supreme Courtrejected an effort by oil and gas companiesto block a climate lawsuit filed by Honolulu, and in March the justicesturned down a requestby Republican attorneys general to try to stop climate lawsuits filed by states including California, Connecticut, Minnesota and Rhode Island. The American Petroleum Institute said in statements to NPR at the time that it was disappointed by the Supreme Court's decisions, saying the lawsuits are a \"distraction\" and \"waste of taxpayer resources.\"\nHowever, the issue has caught the attention of the Trump administration. On May 1, theJustice Department suedMichigan and Hawaii to try to stop those states from filing climate lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry.\nDouglas Kysar, faculty director of the Law, Environment and Animals Program at Yale Law School, said Leon's lawsuit stands out from other climate cases that are working their way through the courts.\n\"The advantage of this lawsuit is that it puts an individual human face on the massive harmful consequences of collective climate inaction,\" Kysar said in an email to NPR. \"Not only that, the complaint tells a story of industry betrayal of public trust through the eyes of a particular person.\"",

But she and her partner at their San Francisco-based startup BOND got a working version of a new online productivity manager and websiteup and running in less than a day.\n\"He was on his way back from a ski trip and built the entire back end … in six hours. And I built the front end in, like, an hour-and-a-half, and we just had a functional product,\" Samaha said.\nThey did it mostly by \"vibe coding\" — using fast-evolving artificial intelligence chatbots, as well as other new AI tools, to write the software for them.\nIt helped Samaha go from a concept for what she calls \"an AI chief of staff for CEOs and busy execs\" to a prototype and then a product on the market with lightning speed.\nIt also highlights advances in AI that are opening up possibilities for creators and shaking up the world of software engineering.\nSamaha, 21, saidBOND's product, called \"Donna\" (named after a character on the TV seriesSuits), taps into users' data from various platforms, like email, calendars or Slack, and uses AI to give instant answers to questions about things like progress on projects and team performance.\nThe firm recently got a $500,000 investment from the venture capital firm and tech incubator Y Combinator.\nTom Blomfield is a group partner there. He said the term \"vibe coding\" was coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy earlier this year in atweet.\n\"It really caught on, this idea that people are no longer checking line by line the code that AI is producing, but just kind of telling it what to do and accepting the responses in a very trusting way,\" Blomfield said.\nAnd so Blomfield, who knows how to code, also tried his hand at vibe coding — both to rejig his blog and to create from scratch a website calledRecipe Ninja. It has a library of recipes, and cooks can talk to it, asking the AI-driven site to concoct new recipes for them.\n\"It's probably like 30,000 lines of code. That would have taken me, I don't know, maybe a year to build,\" he said. \"It wasn't overnight, but I probably spent 100 hours on that.\"\nBlomfield said he expects AI coding to radically change the software industry. \"Instead of having coding assistance, we're going to have actual AI coders and then an AI project manager, an AI designer and, over time, an AI manager of all of this. And we're going to have swarms of these things,\" he said.\nWhere people fit into this, he said, \"is the question we're all grappling with.\"\nIn 2021, Blomfield said in a podcast that would-be start-up founders should, first and foremost, learn to code. Today, he's not sure he'd give that advice because he thinks coders and software engineers could eventually be out of a job.\n\"Coders feel like they are tending, kind of, organic gardens by hand,\" he said. \"But we are producing these superhuman agents that are going to be as good as the best coders in the world, like very, very soon.\"\nOthers are less sure that the future for coders is so grim.\nTools that are now available for vibe coding are lowering the barrier to entry for software development. For many designers, it's a boon. They can now try lots of things quickly, rather than having to hand their ideas off to software engineers to create prototypes, one by one.\n\"For every idea, there are 10 ideas that are not explored today because there simply isn't the time,\" said Yuhki Yamashita, chief product officer at Figma, a leading design software firm.\nEarlier this month, Figma rolled out an AI-enabled product that effectively lets designers vibe code. \"So we think that more ideas will be explored and more ideas will be validated much, much faster,\" Yamashita said.\nThomas Dohmke, CEO of the software development platformGitHub, which is owned by Microsoft, said AI is a \"huge opportunity for software developers.\" He sees a future where software developers may be like conductors presiding over orchestras of AI coding agents.\n\"The question is, from my perspective, not so much: Is the job going to go away? But: How is the job going to evolve?\" he said.\n\"There is going to be a commoditization of simple tasks that AI can do, and there always has been. If you can automate it, developers will do that because they have so much work to do,\" he continued.\nAdam Resnick, a research manager with the tech consultancy IDC, said software developers who might be worried about their jobs still have some runway ahead of them — even if things are progressing quickly.\n\"The vast majority of developers are using AI tools in some way,\" he said. \"And what we also see is that a reasonably high percentage of the code output from those tools needs further curation by people, by experienced people.\"\nAnd that's a job that AI can't do, he said. At least not yet.",

One of the Massachusetts-based grocer's stores is seen here in 2014, when Demoulas thwarted an attempt to force him out.Steven Senne/APhide caption\nA long-running family feud is once again roiling Market Basket, an iconic New England grocery chain with at least 90 stores. The company's board has placed its CEO, Arthur T. Demoulas, on leave — a move that comes a decade after an attempt to oust Demoulas was thwarted partly by an employee strike.\nIn the current controversy, the board cited oversight concerns and disputed succession plans as it announced its move against Demoulas.\nIf you're not familiar with the stores, Market Basket is \"a whole thing in Greater Boston,\" asmember station WBURreports: a cultural icon beloved for high-quality foods at reasonable prices. The supermarket chain's roots extend to 1917, when Greek immigrant Athanasios \"Arthur\" Demoulasopened a store in Lowell, Mass. The business now also operates in New Hampshire and Maine. But as it has grown, family squabbles have persisted.\nTwo of Athanasios Demoulas's sons grew Market Basket into a regional supermarket chain, as WBUR's Curt Nickishreported on NPRin 2014.\n\"Their sons have been feuding for decades. An epic legal battle between the two in the 1990s featured a courtroom fistfight.\"\nThe executive committee of Market Basket's boardsaid in a statementthat it put Demoulas and several employees on paid leave, \"effective immediately while an investigation is conducted into the CEO's conduct.\"\nThe board alleged that Demoulas has been planning a work stoppage to disrupt the business — an act they believe to be \"improper retaliation\" after the board required the CEO to cooperate with what they characterized as \"the most basic corporate oversight.\"\nThe board added, \"Demoulas has also resisted an appropriate succession plan for Market Basket, asserting that he has the unilateral right to appoint his children to succeed him\" without the board's input.\nA representative for Arthur T. Demoulas didn't immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment. But in a statementquoted by WBURand other local news outlets, spokesperson Justine Griffin called the board's claim of an investigation \"a farcical cover for a hostile takeover.\"\n\"Griffin said Demoulas' three sisters and their three appointed board members were responsible for placing the CEO on leave,\" according to WBUR. She also reportedly said the move against Demoulas comes at a time when the company is thriving financially.\nDiscord in the family controlling the Market Basket company made headlines more than 10 years ago, when Arthur T. Demoulas' cousin, Arthur S. Demoulas, led a push to oust him as CEO. The two are grandsons of founder Athanasios \"Arthur\" Demoulas.\n\"An element of distrust has existed between the two factions for years,\" Dave Solomon of theNew Hampshire Union Leadertold New Hampshire Public Radioin 2013, as the feud between two sides of the family began to spill into an outright struggle for control.\nIn the summer of 2014, Arthur S. Demoulas succeeded in pushing out his cousin, the CEO many employees called \"ATD.\" But the change ignited weeks of turmoil and boycotts by customers and employees loyal to Arthur T. Demoulas. Many of Market Basket's more than 25,000 workers walked off the job — a stunning move considering that the companywasn't unionized, and the workers were acting to help a CEO return to running what was then a multi-billion-dollar firm.\nAt the time, workers cited their relationships with Arthur T. Demoulas, along with a positive work environment and fears that new executives might axe their bonuses.\n\"Mr. Demoulas, ATD, is the heart and soul of Market Basket. Everything that this place is built upon, it's him,\" store manager Jamie Cunneentold Nickishin 2014.\nAfter nearly two months, Demoulas succeeded in regaining the CEO post. He and his siblings had offered a buyout reportedly worthmore than $1.5 billionto gain majority control of the company from the faction led by his cousin.\nAccording to the board's message this week, Demoulas is himself a minority shareholder in the family business.\nAs it announced the CEO's on-leave status, the board said its actions won't affect the company's ownership structure — or workers' pay and benefits, including their profit-sharing plan.",

The U.S. dollar rose against the yen and euro.\nThe court found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump has cited as his basis for ordering massive increases in import duties, does not authorize the use of tariffs.\nThe White House immediately appealed and it was unclear if Trump would abide by the ruling in the interim. The long term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. But investors appeared to take heart after the months of turmoil brought on by Trump's trade war.\nThe future for the S&P 500 was up 1.5% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%.\nIn early European trading, Germany's DAX gained 0.5% to 24,160.75. The CAC 40 in Paris jumped 0.9% to 7,860.67. Britain's FTSE was nearly unchanged at 8,722.63.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.9% to 38,432.98. American's largest ally in Asia has been appealing to Trump to cancel the tariffs he has ordered on imports from Japan and to also stop 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos.\nThe ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen. It was trading at 145.40 yen early Thursday, up from 144.87 yen late Wednesday.\nA three-judge panel ruled on several lawsuits arguing Trump exceeded his authority, casting doubt on trade policies that have jolted global financial markets, frustrated trade partners and raised uncertainty over the outlook for inflation and the global economy.\nMany of Trump's double-digit tariff hikes are paused for up to 90 days to allow time for trade negotiations, but the uncertainty they cast over global commerce has stymied businesses and left consumers wary about what lies ahead.\n\"Just when traders thought they'd seen every twist in the tariff saga, the gavel dropped like a lightning bolt over the Pacific,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\nThe ruling was, at the least, \"a brief respite before the next thunderclap,\" he said.\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 1.3% to 23,561.86, while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.7% to 3,363.45.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2% to 8,409.80.\nIn South Korea, which like Japan relies heavily on exports to the U.S., the Kospi surged 1.9% to 2,720.64. Shares also were helped by the Bank of Korea's decision to cut its key interest rate to 2.5% from 2.75%, to ease pressure on the economy.\nTaiwan's Taiex edged 0.1% lower, and India's Sensex lost 0.2%.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. stocks cooled, with the S&P 500 down 0.6% but still within 4.2% of its record after charging higher amid hopes that the worst of the turmoil caused byTrump's trade warmay have passed. It had been roughly 20% below the mark last month.\nThe Dow industrials lost 0.6% and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%.\nTrading was relatively quiet ahead of a quarterly earnings release for Nvidia, which came after markets closed.\nThe bellwether for artificial intelligence overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth thanks to feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human. Nvidia's shares jumped 6.6% in afterhours trading.\nLike Nvidia, Macy's stock also swung up and down through much of the day, even though it reported milder drops in revenue and profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its stock ended the day down 0.3%.\nThe bond market showed relatively little reaction after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its latest meeting earlier this month, when it left its benchmark lending rate alone for the third straight time. The central bank has been holding off on cuts to interest rates, which would give the economy a boost, amid worries about inflation staying higher than hoped because of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\nIn other dealings early Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.52% from 4.47% late Wednesday.\nU.S. benchmark crude oil gained $1.06 to $62.90 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added $1.00 to $65.32 per barrel.\nThe euro slipped to $1.1280 from $1.1292.",

In a ruling that surprised many, the trade court ruled Wednesday in an opinion by a three-judge panel that a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant Trump \"unbounded\" authority to impose the worldwide and retaliatory tariffs he has issued by executive order. Then, on Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted the Trump administration's request to temporarily put on hold the trade court's judgment.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District on Thursdaygranted the Trump administration's requestto temporarily put on hold the New York-based Court of International Trade judgment that struck down President Trump's tariffs a day earlier.\nThe court stayed the order while the legal proceedings play out.\nThe plaintiffs — a group of U.S. states and small businesses — were asked to respond to the Trump administration's motions for a stay by June 5. A U.S. government response may be filed by June 9, the court said.\nThe order capped a frenzy of news related to the president's tariff policy. On Wednesday evening, the Court of International Trade ruled that thetariffs Trump imposedon April 2 on most countries are illegal. And earlier Thursday, a second federal court — the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia — blocked Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, ruling in favor of two Illinois toy importers, but the judge in the case, Rudolph Contreras, paused his ruling for 14 days while the government appeals. Both those courts ruled that the tariffs exceeded the president's power under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which the Trump administration cited in imposing those tariffs.\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Thursday: \"We expect to fight this battle all the way to the Supreme Court.\"\nPresident Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2 in Washington, D.C.Mark Schiefelbein/APhide caption\nWednesday's order — and what is almost certain to be a prolonged legal battle — struck at the heart of the sweeping tariffs, which unsettled consumers and sent stock markets plummeting.\nTrump had moved to temporarily scale down those tariffs back to 10%. The ruling also struck down separate tariffs Trump imposed on China, Canada and Mexico, which the administration justified as a reaction to fentanyl trafficking.\nIn their Wednesdayruling, the court's three-judge panel wrote that Trump's worldwide tariffs had exceeded his power under IEEPA.\n\"Because of the Constitution's express allocation of the tariff power to Congress … we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,\" the court wrote.\nThe White House responded by rejecting the court's authority.\n\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.\"\nIEEPA, the law at the heart of the case, had never been used to impose tariffs until Trump did so. As the name suggests, the law gives a president broad economic powers during a national emergency.\nThe judgment came in a case brought against the administration by 12 states and five businesses.\nWhile the court found Trump had exceeded his authority by imposing broad worldwide tariffs, the three-judge panel made a different argument in ruling against the fentanyl tariffs.\nIn that case, the court found that the president's argument — that the tariffs will create leverage to get other countries to crack down on drug trade — invalidates the tariffs. Under IEEPA, the judges wrote, a tariff must directly \"deal with\" the emergency a president cites when imposing the tariff. The fentanyl tariffs do not directly address the drug trade, the judges wrote, but instead merely attempt to create economic pressure within other countries.\nThe three judges were appointed by three separate presidents: Barack Obama, Ronald Reagan and Trump himself.",

        "content": "Homebuilding has slowed as Americans face economic uncertainty and high mortgage rates. Here, construction workers install a lumber roof on a new home last month in Laveen, Ariz.Ross D. Franklin/APhide caption\nEconomic uncertainty has produced a double whammy for the housing market: sluggish home sales and plodding construction. Last month was the slowest April for existing home sales in 16 years — a sharp rebuke to hopes that this spring the housing market would recoverafter two very sleepy years.\nIn a May survey of builder confidence conducted by Wells Fargo and the National Association of Home Builders,home builder sentimentdropped to a level last seen in November 2023.\nThe problem, as ever, is the cost of housing: Home prices are out of reach for many who would like to buy. And the tariff drama under President Trump has both made it more expensive to build new homes and made the future more unpredictable for would-be homebuyers.\nThe result is a country where builders want to build, and buyers want to buy — but the future is too much in doubt.\nThe first issue is a dip in demand. Lots of Americans would love to buy a home, but they simply can't afford to. Home prices are up nearly 50% since before the pandemic, and mortgage interest ratesticked up to 6.86%last week — a far cry from their pandemic low of 2.65% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan.\nThe median existing home sales price continued to climb nationally, to $414,000 — an all-time high for the month of April and the 22nd consecutive month of year-over-year price increases.\nHome sales remain at just 75% of pre-pandemic activity, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, despite the U.S. adding millions of jobs.\n\"Pent-up housing demand continues to grow, though not realized,\" Yun said ina statementaccompanying April's disappointing sales figures. \"Any meaningful decline in mortgage rates will help release this demand.\"\nThen there's the complicated outlook for supply.\nConstruction of single-family homes dropped in April, according tofigures from the Census Bureau. Every indicator concerning single-family homes — building permits, starts of new homes and completions — was down compared to a year ago. Permits for buildings with five or more units are also down more than 5% so far this year.\nThat may have consequences for the future: A lack of permits now can mean fewer homes hitting the market later.\nIn addition, \"the tariff debate has created a lot of uncertainty,\" says Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.\nOne of the big issues, he says, is Canadian lumber: \"Wood framed homes represent about 90% of single-family home building and about a quarter of softwood lumber that we use comes from Canada.\"\nThere's currently a 14.5% duty on that Canadian lumber (it washiked from 8.05% last August). But further review from the Department of Commerce is coming, which could push that number higher. The cost of framing lumber isup about 16%over a year ago.\nIt's worth noting that the U.S. Lumber Coalition disputes the notion that lumber tariffs are to blame for driving up home prices. The coalitionaccuses Canada of dumping excess supplyinto the U.S. market and says that lumber accounts forless than 2% of the costof building the average new home.\nFor its part, the NAHB says softwood accounts for about 6% of the cost of a single-family home, when lumber, panels and millwork are taken into account.\nThe average impact of all tariffs enacted or expected so far, including on lumber, is nearly $11,000 per single-family home, says Dietz.\nA \"For sale\" sign sits in front of a home earlier this month in Miami. Home sales have been plodding this year.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption\nAccording to the NAHB/Wells Fargo survey,78% of builders reported difficultypricing their homes: They don't know how much it will cost to build them, and they don't know how much they can sell for.\nWhen costs are growing but builders can't raise prices, housing production slows down.\nAnd although the outlook for new home construction is cloudy, part of the issue for builders is that right now there are plenty of existing homes for sale. Many people listed their homes to sell in the last few months, pushing inventory more than 20% higher than a year ago.\nThat competition means it could be harder to sell new homes, and builders will have to cut prices. The May NAHB/Wells Fargo survey found that 34% of builders had cut prices during the month, up from 29% in April. Despite what Dietz called a \"surprise\" bounce innew home sales in April's report, overall they are down over 1% this year to date.\nMany Americans had hoped to buy a home this spring but have instead been stymied by concerns about a possible job loss, high mortgage rates and stock market volatility. In short, many would-be buyers are finding reasons to wait.\nOne of them is 32-year-old Kassandra Ford, a biology professor.\nShe and her mom planned to buy a home together in the Twin Cities, where Ford lives, after her mom sold her house this spring near Spartanburg, S.C. They found the market there to be awfully slow: It took about 3 1/2 months to sell the house.\nBut when it came time to shop for their multigenerational home in St. Paul, they ran into competition: the Midwest is theoneregion where sales climbed last month.\nAfter getting outbid twice — offering the asking price on one home and $15,000 above asking on another — they decided to take a breather.\n\"I'm keeping an eye on Zillow, but unlike before, when I was probably looking every day, now it's maybe once or twice a week,\" says Ford. \"It feels very much like we're in a holding pattern.\"\nInstead of taking out a mortgage, Ford re-signed a lease on her two-bedroom apartment, and her mom moved in with her. \"Especially with the economy, honestly, it's going to be great to be able to have some shared expenses with somebody as well.\"\nThey plan to try again to buy, in a different season. Until then, they'll keep adding to their down payment fund.\n\"We're just going to hold tight, hold on to what we have, and keep an eye on things,\" says Ford.",

They make fans and heaters, for which American importers would normally be placing orders in just a few weeks in preparation for the fall. But this year, overall sales volumes are low.\n\"Some [American retailers] still have not made a decision [about whether to buy from us]. They have not responded to our emails. Maybe they are still waiting and watching,\" says Ivy Lee, a sales manager at a Chinese homeware manufacturer that sold to retailers like Walmart before the tariffs hit.\nLee believes demand will return eventually: \"These are everyday consumables. If they need them, they will buy.\" As for the broader uncertainty, she adds, \"I try not to worry too much. Policy changes are out of our hands.\"\nSome small businesses in the U.S. are rushing to buy whatever stock Chinese factories already have on hand, in case tariffs go back up again.\n\"For now, everyone is trying to get as much of their shipments to the U.S. completed as possible within these few months,\" saysTian Xin, a freight forwarder who arranges logistics for large freight and also coordinates paperwork for customs clearance for Chinese exports.\nJenny Tianworks in freight forwarding in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen and says she has been fielding calls for huge product orders. But the problem is shipping.\n\"We might soon be facing what we call 'container rollovers,' where even if you have already paid for a container spot on the ship, your container might not get loaded and is pushed onto the next available vessel,\" Tian says. For her company, the cost of shipping to the West Coast of the U.S. has increased by $1,500 per container.\nMany ships servicing the routes between the West Coast and China have been diverted to other routes, creating delays as exporters in China wait for ships to return to ports in China.\n\"You need those vessels at minimum to come back [to China], and you create disturbances, and you don't have enough empty containers, et cetera,\" says Eric Martin-Neuville, an executive vice president in Singapore for GEODIS, the French logistics company.\nIn the meantime, Chinese freight forwarders are making immediate contingency plans that exclude selling to the U.S.\n\"We have to be looking every day\" for new clients, says Mike Zhong, a freight forwarder based in southern China.\nChris Que, a regional director at a home appliances factory in the southern city of Guangzhou, says his company has held off selling to the U.S. market for now, due to concerns over volatility. The company produces home appliances, including gas boilers and heat pumps.\n\"The U.S. policies are unstable right now. Tariffs can be raised or changed at any moment,\" said Que. Instead, he is focusing on European customers.\nData from China's national statistics bureau shows that when U.S. tariffs reached their peak, the value of overall exportsactually jumpedby 8.1% in April when compared to the previous year,beatingeconomists' predictions.\nTrade with the U.S had dropped, but exports to Southeast Asia and Europesurgedby levels high enough to make up for the lost business — though it is possible some of those exports stillended upin the U.S.\nEmily Feng reported from Washington, D.C., and Aowen Cao contributed research from Beijing.",

        "content": "NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher testifies during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing at the U.S. Capitol on March 26, 2025. NPR and several member stations are suing the Trump administration over an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to stop funding NPR and PBS.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption\nNPR and three Colorado public radio stations filed suit Tuesday morning in federal court against the Trump White House over thepresident's executive orderthat purportedly bars the use of Congressionally appropriated funds for NPR and PBS.\n\"It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. 'But this wolf comes as a wolf,'\" the legal filling for the public broadcasters states. \"The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President's view, their news and other content is not 'fair, accurate, or unbiased.'\"\nThe line about the \"wolf\" was drawn from a1988 dissentby the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\nThe lawsuit says the administration is usurping Congress' power to direct how federal money will be spent and to pass laws. It names President Trump, White House budget director Russell Vought, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Maria Rosario Jackson, the chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, as defendants.\nA team that includes noted free speech lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous filed the lawsuit for NPR and the Colorado stationsjointly in the District of Columbia. The suit calls Trump'searly May executive order\"textbook retaliation\" and an existential threat to the public radio system \"that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.\"\n\"The Executive Order is a clear violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech and association, and freedom of the press,\" NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher said in a statement.\nPBS is not a party to the lawsuit. The television network issued a statement Tuesday morning saying, \"PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans.\"\nThe differing profiles of the three local stations joining NPR in the suit capture the appeal and reach of the broader public radio system: the statewideColorado Public Radio, which is based in Denver;Aspen Public Radiowhich broadcasts throughout the Roaring Fork Valley; andKSUT, originally founded by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and now serving four federally recognized tribes in the Four Corners region in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.\n\"Our mission — and our responsibility — is grounded in the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press and protects our ability to hold those in power to account without interference,\" the stations said in a joint statement. \"This includes protection against government interference in our editorial decisions as well as in purchasing, acquiring, producing and broadcasting information.\"\nThe case is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Randolph D. Moss, who is also handling a case involvinga related lawsuitfiled by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) against Trump.\nTrump's May 1st executive order took the form of a directive to the board of the CPB, which distributes more than a half-billion dollars each year to public broadcasters, primarily to local stations. By statute, three quarters of that money is devoted to television, one quarter to radio.\nTrump cited his authority as president under the Constitution and federal laws in making the order and said that neither NPR nor PBS \"presents a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\" In other public statements, Trump and his allies have called the public broadcasters \"left-wing propaganda\" and made similarly disparaging remarks. An accompanying fact sheetput out by the White Housecited the claim that NPR published articles \"insist[ing] that COVID-19 did not originate in a lab\" and \"refused to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story.\"\n\"The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime. Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS,\" said Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, in a statement on Tuesday. \"The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.\"\nNPR's Maher rejected such ideological characterizations, pointing to such statements by Trump to argue he was seeking to exact illegal retribution for their news coverage.\n\"This is retaliatory, viewpoint-based discrimination in violation of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled numerous times over the past 80 years that the government does not have the right to determine what counts as 'biased',\" Maher said in her statement Tuesday. \"NPR will never agree to this infringement of our constitutional rights, or the constitutional rights of our Member stations, and NPR will not compromise our commitment to an independent free press and journalistic integrity.\"\nTrump's legal standing to make such a decree was in question even before Tuesday's lawsuit was filed.\nCongress allocates money for the CPB two years in advance to insulate public broadcasters from political pressure over fleeting controversies. The CPB was authorized by Congressional statute but set up as a private corporation. Indeed,the organization is itself suing Trump over an earlier decree, in which he claimed to be firing three of the five members of CPB's board of directors.\nWhen Trump said he was ordering the CPB not to fund NPR or PBS any longer, the corporation's chief executive said he had no ability to do so.\n\"CPB is not a federal executive agency subject to the President's authority,\" CPB chief Patricia Harrison, a former Republican National Committee co-chair, said then in a statement. \"Congress directly authorized and funded CPB to be a private nonprofit corporation wholly independent of the federal government.\"\nIn the statement, Harrison noted thatthe statute Congress passed to create CPB\"expressly forbade 'any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over educational television or radio broadcasting, or over [CPB] or any of its grantees or contractors.\"\nHarrison and CPB have effectively ignored Trump's orders — retaining, for now, its board members, as the case works through the federal courts — and taking no actions to withhold money from NPR and PBS or the hundreds of stations that send funds to the two national broadcasters.\nTrump specified in his order that recipients of federal funds from CPB could not, under his decree, send money to PBS and NPR. NPR typically receives about 1% of its annual revenues from the CPB and another several percent indirectly from stations. On average, CPB provides each public radio station 8 to 10% of their revenues each year. (The NEA often gives smaller grants to NPR; the NEA terminated one such award to NPR the day after Trump's executive order, according to the lawsuit.)\nThe relationship between NPR and member stations is closely intertwined, with public radio considering itself an interconnected system. NPR's weekly audience for its programs, articles, podcasts and other offerings exceeds 43 million Americans, according to the network, including through its local stations. NPR does not own any stations itself.\nLocal station reporters appear frequently on NPR news magazines; the network often provides editing and guidance for regional collaborations between local stations; and NPR News member stations pledge to adhere to a shared set of ethical standards. NPR manages and operates the terrestrial distribution system allowing member stations and community broadcasters to deliver and download content for broadcast.\nThe executive order is but one front in the Trump administration's assault on the news media writ large.\nAs a private citizen, Trump has sued ABC, CBS, Meta and X (formerly Twitter). All but CBS paid him settlements of $10 million or more, despite legal observers' saying the cases were weak.\nCBS's parent company,Paramount Global is in settlement talks with Trumpas federal regulators weigh whether to approve its $8 billion sale to Skydance Media. Trump sued CBS over a60 Minutesinterview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. Trump alleged that the network's editing of her answer to a question about Israel and Gaza amounted to election fraud; media lawyers and First Amendment scholars almost universally say the case should be dismissed on Constitutional free speech protections.\nTrump's appointee as chairperson of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, has saidhe is open to stripping CBS of the licenses it holds for local television stationsover the60 Minutesinterview, saying \"it's not a threat, that's a penalty.\"\nIndeed, in just a few months as chair, Carr has initiated investigations of all the major broadcast networks — save Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, an ally of the president.\nYet public media has come in for particular focus.\nTrump's Republican allies in the U.S. House held a hearingin March at which Maher was assailed for both personal social media posts showing a liberal tilt years before she joined the network, and journalism published before her arrival. (In her testimony, Maher pointed to NPR's policies that include a firewall preventing corporate executives from making editorial judgments for the newsroom.)\nPBS chief Paula Kerger was asked about a video posted on a New York City public television's website featuring a drag queen for a show intended for young children.

He suggested they are indistinguishable from commercials on for-profit networks, a violation of federal statute. (PBS and NPR say they have worked closely with agency staffers for decades to ensure those spots adhere to the law.) Carr's FCC oversees to whom licenses are granted to broadcast using the federal airwaves.\nAnd Trump has called on Congress to eliminate all current and future funding for public media and CPB, though he has not sent lawmakers a formal request for the current funding to be clawed back.\nEarlier this spring, the Republican-led Congress passed a stop-gap budget measure that fully funds CPB through the end of September 2027.\nDisclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by Deputy Business Editor Emily Kopp, Managing Editor Vickie Walton-James and Managing Editor Gerry Holmes.

        "content": "This is Part 2 in our series on manufacturing in America.Part 1asked why Americans aren't filling the manufacturing jobs that are already here. Subscribe to thePlanet Moneynewsletterfor the next installment. As always,our podcast is here.\nPoliticians in both big political parties have been trying to reengineer the U.S. economy to boost manufacturing. What makes manufacturing so special? Besides, you know, politics.\nSome writers and economists say that romanticizing this one particular sector of the economy is more about nostalgia or political pandering than rational thinking about what will best serve workers and the economy.\nPutting aside the debate about whether politicians can successfully bring back a large number of manufacturing jobs — many economists are skeptical of this —we atPlanet Moneywere curious, on a deeper level, about what makes manufacturing special enough to warrant all this ruckus in the first place?\nSo we pored over nerdy econ studies and data, and we called up a bunch of economists, including two Nobel laureates.\nWe're going to look at this question from two perspectives. The first is whether manufacturing is special for workers. That will be the focus of thisPlanet Moneynewsletter. The second, which will be the focus of aforthcoming newsletter, is whether manufacturing is special for the broader economy.\n\"Manufacturing is special,\" says Gordon Hanson, an economist at Harvard Kennedy School who has published influential research on American manufacturing. \" That's because as long as we've been able to measure earnings in the sector, it's just paid workers more, especially workers without a college education.\"\nEconomists call this \"the manufacturing premium.\" And it's worth noting thatsome researchsuggests that the manufacturing premium has fallen or even disappeared in recent decades.\nHowever, Hanson and other economists we spoke to said the most convincing evidence on this subject shows that the manufacturing premium is still alive and well. In particular, they cited arecent, peer-reviewed studyfrom economists David Card, Jesse Rothstein and Moises Yi. Hanson calls it \"the gold standard.\" The economists use much richer, more comprehensive data than previous studies. And they deploy this pretty cool technique that helps them see, systematically, what happened to the pay of over 100 million Americans as they jumped between industries.\n\" We basically take every single workplace in the United States, and we watch workers as they move from workplace to workplace,\" says Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley who — ummm, flex — won the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. (Read thisPlanet Moneynewsletter that explains why he won the Nobel.)\nNow, it's no secret that industries like tech, finance, law and medicine pay workers a lot. But those high-earners usually have advanced degrees and valuable skills or abilities. Had they not gone into their chosen industry, they would probably have made good money in another industry. It's hard to know how much of their pay is the result of their own special sauce and how much of it is driven by something else in their chosen industry. Like how profitable it is. Where it's located. How unionized it is. The management or culture or size of its companies. Whether it's competitive. And so on.\nIt's a similar issue when analyzing manufacturing. The average manufacturing worker makesover $35an hour,according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a lot more than the average earnings of workers at restaurants, which isabout $21an hour. What accounts for this pay difference? The workers themselves or something about these industries?\nImagine what would happen if you could run an experiment and you could see, systematically, what happened when you plopped restaurant workers into manufacturing, or vice versa. That's kinda what the economists do in this paper, statistically speaking. And it's not just restaurants and manufacturers. It's basically every industry.\nUsing a massive dataset, the economists track what happens to millions and millions of workers as those same workers move to different industries. This allows them to control for age, education and experience, like other studies do, but they can also go a step further. Because they're tracking the same workers, they're controlling for worker qualities that are not easily seen in data — like their grit, their know-how, their work ethic, their rizz.\nWith this technique, the economists can cut through more of the noise of why particular industries pay particular workers particular wages. They can get more to the heart of the actual, causal effect on what working in a particular industry can do to people's incomes — in a sense, how special an industry is.\nCard, Rothstein and Yi use restaurants as the base industry to compare with other industries. This, they write, is the industry with the lowest average earnings in their data. Think fast-food and cafeteria workers, cooks and servers. The baseline could really be any industry. It's a bit arbitrary because they measure all industry premiums against this same baseline.\nYou can think of the industry premiums they find below as basically the pay bump the average person would get from quitting a job in this mostly low-wage service sector and getting one in another industry, without going back to school or dramatically changing the skills or capabilities they already have.\nThe economists calculate that, on average, if a worker jumps from working in restaurants to working in manufacturing, they get a 35% pay bump.\nThat's a substantial premium, higher than if they went into retail (an 11% premium), education (a 13% premium), agriculture (a 16% premium), health care (a 19% premium), transportation and warehousing (a 24% premium), construction (a 25% premium), finance and insurance (a 32% premium) and professional, scientific and technical services (a 33% premium). Pretty special!\nHowever, the manufacturing premium is lower than that of some other sectors, including \"information,\" which includes the movie, publishing, broadcasting and telecommunications industries (a 39% premium); utilities (a 49% premium); and mining, quarrying, oil and gas (a 62% premium). OK, so manufacturing is medium-ish special.\nThat said, the 35% percent pay bump in manufacturing is the average for a pretty diverse sector. Manufacturers make all sorts of things: socks, rockets, potato chips, petrochemicals, mannequins, skateboards, electronics, cars, Twinkies, you name it.\nSo Card, Rothstein and Yi break down the manufacturing premium, looking at what it is in various subsectors.\nThey find that in the low end of the manufacturing spectrum are industries that make apparel and leather (a 15% premium), furniture (a 19% premium) and textile mill and wood products (a 22% premium). Hmmm. Not so special compared with a lot of other industries.\nIn the middle are manufacturing subsectors like plastics and rubber (a 30% premium) and food products (a 32% premium). OK, yeah, now we're cooking.\nAnd at the high end are industries that manufacture computers and electronics (a 42% premium), transportation equipment, so like cars, ships and planes (a 43% premium), chemicals (a 47% premium) and — the highest of all — petroleum and coal (a 62% premium).\nWowzer. That last one especially — that's a big premium. In fact, next to mining, it has the highest premium in all the industries the economists look at. It helps explain why — despite rising concerns about climate change — these fossil fuel-producing jobs are so politically popular in many parts of the United States.\nA clear takeaway from this data is that high-end manufacturing offers workers a significant pay bump relative to other industries. Low-end manufacturing, of things like apparel and furniture, not so much.\nCard, Rothstein and Yi don't provide definitive answers for why manufacturing pays a premium. There are many plausible explanations.\nOne is that manufacturing has a history of being a more unionized sector, which led to higher pay and benefits. A core idea here is unions force business owners and managers to share more of their profits with workers.\nDaron Acemoglu, the 2024 winner of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, told us he believes manufacturing is special because, at least historically, it has been a union bastion.\n\" Manufacturing is super important for unionization,\" Acemoglu says. \"So if you want to have unions in your economy, you want manufacturing. They unionize themselves and they unionize other sectors.\"\nSome pro-union advocates have gone so far as to argue that Americans are nostalgic for an era of lots of manufacturing jobs not because they were good jobs per se, but because they were good,unionjobs. The implication: Promote unions, not manufacturing.\nEconomists debate why manufacturing has been more prone to unionization, but one leading explanation is the fact that workers in this industry tend to work at one large workplace (the factory) and,at least during some periods historically, they had lower turnover, which maybe helps create more personal connections and solidarity between workers. Plus, under U.S. law, unionization has to happen at the workplace (or \"establishment\") level, and unionizing smaller service-sector workplaces is harder. Instead of unionizing one big factory, workers have to unionize Starbucks by Starbucks or Walmart by Walmart. (Read more about unions in a previousPlanet Moneynewsletter.)\nHowever, it's also true that the unionization rate in manufacturing hasfallen pretty precipitouslyin the United States and that many manufacturing plants are not unionized, especially in the Midwest and South, where a lot of states have passedlawsthat make unionizing more difficult.\nIn fact, in 2023, onlyabout 7.9%of manufacturing workers were unionized, which is not crazy different from the overall union membership rate in the private sector, which stood at about5.9%.\nAnother potential hypothesis for why there's a manufacturing premium: Working in factories may be more dangerous than working in a lot of service jobs, and so manufacturers may have to pay a premium to attract workers willing to take on greater risk (economists call this a \"compensating differential\"). This is a classic explanation for why coal mining pays a premium.\nHowever, the data doesn't seem to really support this hypothesis in manufacturing. According todata from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2023 the fatal injury rate in manufacturing was 2.5 per 100,000 workers. That's slightly higher than industries like restaurants (1.6), retail trade (2.1) and leisure and hospitality (2.3) but well under construction (9.6), transportation and warehousing (12.9) and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (20.3). Manufacturing also doesn't look particularly more dangerous than other sectors when it comes tononfatal injuriesorillnesses.\nIt's also possible manufacturers have to compensate workers because many believe factory work is unpleasant. In fact,severallargeReddit threadsformed in response to thelastPlanet Moneynewsletteron workforce issues in manufacturing. Many commenters were manufacturing workers themselves. And some talked about how uncomfortable factory jobs can be — including details like factory floors can get really hot when you're wearing protective gear and standing amid a bunch of machines humming and whirring — how shift schedules can be long and inflexible and how the jobs can be mentally or physically taxing.\nThe Pew Research Centerrecently did a surveythat suggested that manufacturing workers are among a more general group of \"blue-collar\" workers who are more dissatisfied with their jobs than the rest of the workforce. This group also includes those who do manual or physical labor in sectors like mining, agriculture, retail, transportation, construction and restaurants.\nA 2024 Gallup survey found that only 23% of manufacturing workers felt engaged or enthusiastic about their jobs. That was lower than the overall workforce (31%). But it was also lower than some other blue-collar industries, including construction (32%), utilities (30%) and agriculture and mining (29%).\nDislike of factory work might help explain why, despite manufacturing paying a premium,many workers aren't filling these jobs— which may actually increase the size of the premium that manufacturers have to pay to find people to do them.\nThe last big reason that manufacturing may pay a premium: Manufacturing workers handle a lot of expensive machinery. Most of the economists we spoke to stressed this factor. It helps explain the pattern in the premium data we went through before, where more advanced manufacturing — which is filled with a lot of expensive machines — pays an even higher premium.\nFor one, employers may have to pay more to attract people whom they can trust will be careful with their expensive machinery and not screw up productivity on the assembly line. The machines that workers have to operate, Card says, are oftentimes very expensive, \"so you don't want someone goofing off.\"\nOr, worse yet, you don't want workers to intentionally damage this expensive equipment. Rothstein, a co-author of this study and another economist at UC Berkeley, says this fear was more relevant back in the day, when there were violent industrial conflicts. Today, probably not as much. But, he says, it's still true that \"the more capital-intensive you are, the more damage workers can do to you if they decide to go to war against you.\" Don't get these workers angry!\nProbably the most convincing factor though: There's a lot of learning on the job to figure out how to work with this expensive machinery. We reported inour last newsletterhow workers with machine-related skills are very needed in the industry.\nTeaching these skills takes time and money. So maybe employers pay extra to convince workers to not quit and to lower their turnover rates. They also may use higher wages to motivate employees to work hard and be diligent because it's hard to monitor huge factory floors (this is known in economics as the \"efficiency wage hypothesis,\" a theory that employers pay extra to accomplish workforce goals like these).\nMore generally, working with machinery often means you're productive, and productivity is one important factor influencing pay. Also, these advanced manufacturers with expensive machinery are often big, profitable companies.\n\" The kind of standard way that economists have always thought about this is that big firms and capital-intensive production are both good for wages,\" Rothstein says. \"And that's manufacturing, especially advanced manufacturing,\"\nWhatever the reason, according to this research, manufacturing does continue to pay a premium and especially so in advanced manufacturing, where there's a lot of expensive equipment. Pretty special!\nGordon Hanson, together with UC Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti, recently dida studyin which they use a measure of industry pay premiums, similar to Card, Rothstein and Yi, to see which industries have provided good jobs to Americans over the last five decades.\nNow, their definition of \"good jobs\" isn't really how we typically talk about good jobs. Like Card, Rothstein and Yi, they control for worker characteristics when calculating which industries provide jobs with a high pay premium. That takes the focus away from higher education and credentialed skills as the tickets to a well-paying job, because it's holding things like that constant. It's no secret higher education pays in today's job market.\nIn this paper, what they're really interested in, Hanson says, is \"the job market lottery.\" That is, if you don't necessarily have a college degree and if market forces in the job market are kinda stacked against you, which industries allow you to win the lottery and reach the middle class? They define good jobs as those that pay high premiums (in the top third), meaning there's something about these industries that gives workers a big extra pay bump regardless of their background.\nWith this definition of good jobs, they find that, back in 1980, manufacturing accounted for almost40% of all good jobsin America. That was for both college- and non-college-educated workers. It's a pretty stunning statistic.\nThe economists find — not surprisingly — that manufacturing's portion of the nation's good jobs has fallen dramatically over the past few decades as those jobs were automated and offshored away.\nToday, manufacturing accounts for onlyabout 10%of the American workforce. Yet, with this measure, it accounts for about 20% of all good jobs in America. Manufacturing punches far above its weight when it comes to industries that provide an extra pay bump to Americans.\nSo, yeah, Hanson says, manufacturing jobs are special. But over the last few decades many have disappeared. And opportunities for non-college-educated Americans — who represent more than half the workforce — shriveled. The one bright spot, the economists find, was in construction and the skilled trades.\nMeanwhile, good jobs in industries like finance, tech, management and legal services blossomed. These sectors are weird though, Hanson says. They provide tons of opportunities to workers with a college education but very few to those without one.\n\" There are certain types of industries where you can't unlock the productivity magic box without a college degree,\" Hanson says. \" In manufacturing, you can open the magic box without a college degree.\"\nThat said, as we reported in our last newsletter, many manufacturing jobs these days also require a bachelor's degree, and even ones that don't often require an associate degree, a certificate, an apprenticeship or critical vocational skills. Yet, still today, unlike in other sectors, these business enterprises are often socioeconomically and educationally diverse. Despite having higher entry barriers than in past generations, manufacturing still has lower entry barriers for non-college-educated Americans than many other industries to get in the door and see higher wages. And many stress that this is particularly true for non-college-educated men, a population that has seen economic struggles in recent decades.\nDoes that mean the government should do everything it can to boost this one sector?\nMany economists doubt whether the government can do much to dramatically boost the number of manufacturing jobs in the country. For one, many of these jobs have become automated with machines in recent years, and fewer workers are needed. Tariffs might help bring some of these jobs back. But tariffs and the trade retaliation they invite could also hurt other areas of the economy that also provide good jobs — including in American manufacturing, where companies often need foreign parts and materials to efficiently make things in America.\nTariffs also raise prices for everyone, including working-class Americans who make less income and will feel it the most.\n\"I think we've developed a kind of collective fetish for manufacturing, which is really unproductive,\" Hanson says. \"The problem is not too few manufacturing jobs. The problem is too few jobs for workers without a college education.\"\nHanson says, sure, we should try to create more good jobs in manufacturing. He — like many other economists — is skeptical whether we can bring back labor-intensive manufacturing, like in apparel and furniture. And as we showed before, those pay low premiums anyways. They're not a great source of high-paying jobs. And, Hanson says, these jobs are likely not going to come back, because cheap labor is really important to their business model. Slapping tariffs on this stuff, Hanson says, will mean \"we're just gonna charge U.S. consumers a whole lot more for the privilege of consuming T-shirts and tennis shoes and board games and the like.\"\nAmerica continues to have a high-end manufacturing sector that produces things like cars, planes and petrochemicals. And Hanson says we may \"have a shot\" at bringing back some manufacturing jobs in the middle, which produce things like auto parts and machine tools. He says he's open to the idea that strategic, temporary tariffs can help make that happen. He, however, thinks it's much more important for America to invest in workforce development programs, like reforming high school education to offer kids more routes to get vocational skills, and investing in community college programs and apprenticeships to equip Americans with the skills needed to be productive in manufacturing.\nBut the reality, Hanson says, is that manufacturing is only a small slice of the economy — and it will always be a small slice of the economy. So, he says, leaders should be focusing a lot more on creating good jobs in services, because \"most of the good jobs are going to have to be in services.\"\nAnd that could mean trying to replicate some of the things that have made manufacturing jobs special. Like potentially reinvigorating unions, or trying to get more high-paying industries with lots of advanced technology and machinery to open their doors to people without a college education. Hanson imagines companies and the government figuring out more ways to create good jobs for non-college-educated folks in sectors like tech or health care. Our education system andemerging technologycould help make that happen.\nManufacturing, however, is about more than just good jobs.

        "title": "Why Japan sees President Trump's tariffs as a 'national crisis'",
        "content": "The flag of Japan (right) hangs outside the New York Stock Exchange on May 5, 2008, in honor of Ryozo Kato, the ambassador of Japan to the United States at the time, ringing the opening bell.Stan Honda/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nRobert Ward is the Japan chair at the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he also directs the geo-economics and strategy program. He is the author of \"Evaluating Japan's New Grand Strategy\".\nSince President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs that targeted America's friends and foes alike, there has been alarm in Japan, one of the United States' staunchest allies in Asia, which also sees the U.S. as its most important export market,accounting for around 20% of all Japanese exports.\nAlthough many of them are paused, Trump's tariffs present a major threat to Japan's alreadyflagging economy. Adding to the gloom in Tokyo is the uncertainty of U.S. tariff policy toward China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), where Japanese firms are also heavily invested. Small wonder then that Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as a \"national crisis.\"\nIshiba has come under pressure from Japan's opposition parties for his cautious handling of tariff negotiations with the U.S. This partly reflects Japan's electoral cycle. Two important elections loom in July: first the Tokyo assembly poll and then that for the upper house of Japan's parliament. Ishiba and his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) areflagging in the opinion pollsand so may struggle to perform well in these.\nThe LDP with its coalition partner, Komeito, has been a minority government since its poor performance in last year's general election, which was held immediately after Ishiba's appointmentas prime minister. The two parties have a majority in the upper house of parliament, but losing in July would severely compromise the government's ability to enact policy and may even trigger Ishiba's resignation as prime minister. The opposition thus scents blood.\nPresident Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba hold a joint press conference at the White House, on Feb. 7. Ishiba, who took office in October, is the first Asian leader to visit Trump since he returned to the White House.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption\nBut Japan's room for maneuver in tariff negotiations with the U.S. is limited. Unlike, for example, the European Union, it does not enjoy the advantage of being able to negotiate as a bloc. While Japan's is still one of the world's largest economies, its gross domestic product is only just over a 10th the size of the U.S. Access to the U.S. market is also vital for many Japanese firms given the shrinking home market and increasing geopolitical difficulties with the Chinese market. This is one reason forNippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel.\nMoreover, the U.S. is a major supplier of food, raw materials and mineral fuels to Japan. Indeed, these itemsaccount for some 30%of Japan's overall import bill from the U.S., so, Japan can ill afford to enter a full-blown trade war with the U.S. Japan's large holdings of U.S. Treasurys are also unlikely to be weaponized. Japan briefly flirted with this option in a previous bout of bilateral economic tensionin the late 1990s, only to row back quickly.\nTokyo also needs to balance its economic needs with its overriding strategic priority: preserving its security relationship with Washington. The U.S. is Japan's only security treaty ally, and this is unlikely to change. While Ishiba floated the idea ofcreating an Asian NATOjust before becoming prime minister, this looks remote given the paucity of potential partners in the region and the U.S. 's own broader questioning of its overseas security commitments under the second Trump administration.\nThe sharp deterioration in the strategic environment around Japan in recent years has further raised the importance to Tokyo of the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Viewed from Tokyo, its immediate neighbors in continental Asia present an arc of threat, from Russia in the north, with which relations have chilled since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to nuclear-armed and hostile North Korea in the center and China in the south, which is increasing its menacing of Taiwan. China-Russia and Russia-North Korea strategic alignment and cooperation further elevates Japan's strategic anxiety.\nFor these reasons, Japan is also unlikely to seek to hedge against U.S. trade unpredictability through significantly warmer ties with China. Under Ishiba's administration, Sino-Japanese relations have warmed slightly. But there remain significant barriers to deeper improvements. Tokyo's concerns about Beijing's intentions toward Taiwan have been mentioned — it views any cross-strait instability as affecting Japanese security, too. Intensifying Chinese intrusions into waters around Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which lie close to Taiwan and which Japan controls and China claims, are also causing alarm in Tokyo.\nAkira Banzai (center), chief of Japan's farmers association, and their members gesture as they protest against the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade talks at a rally in Tokyo on March 12, 2013, when then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was expected to announce he would join TPP negotiations that week.Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nDespite the constraints, Japan is not without options both in its trade negotiations with the U.S. and more broadly. In terms of the former, Japan could, for example, agree to increase imports of U.S. agricultural goods, notwithstanding the political sensitivities over rice. Japan's agricultural lobby is a shadow of its former self — farmer numbers are dwindling and trade liberalization underPrime Minister Shinzo Abe's2012-2020 administration has reduced its political clout.\nResource-poor Japan could also agree without too much difficulty to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S., orto help fund an LNG project in Alaska. Some concessions on non-tariff barriers to the imports of U.S.-made cars into Japan also look likely. At his first summit with Trump, Ishiba also promised to raise Japan's investment in the U.S. to \"an unprecedented amount\" of $1 trillion, something that Japan will come under pressure to deliver upon.\nJapan also has agency in its other international ties. Japan is, for example, overwhelmingly the largest economy in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) mega trade bloc and its de facto leader. The accession to the CPTPP of the United Kingdom, now a close strategic partner of Japan, in 2024 should give Japan valuable policy support in its efforts to keep global trade channels open. Japan's membership of Asia's other mega trade bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), is also strategically important for Tokyo. Although RCEP is dominated by China, Japan's membership offers Tokyo a chance to help shape any reconfiguration of regional trade triggered by U.S. tariff policy.\nFinally, it is worth noting that few countries have as extensive experience of dealing with lurches in U.S. policy as Japan. Whether after President Richard Nixon'sdelinking of the U.S. dollarfrom gold in 1971, which upended Japan's foreign and economic policy, the U.S. economic \"Japan bashing\" of the 1980s, or the U.S. \"Japan passing\" in favor of China of the 1990s, Japan responded pragmatically by changing policy where needed to ensure it was able to preserve the critical security alliance with the U.S.\nThis time round, Japan is also fortunate that its foreign, geo-economic and defense-policy activism since the Prime Minister Abe's second administration has bequeathed Tokyo some strong tools for dealing with what is shaping up to be another profound shift in the behavior of its key economic and security interlocutor.",

The title represents the pinnacle of her once-hot profession, and the promotion she was working toward before she was laid off in August — and found the DEI job market had turned into a toxic wasteland.\n\"I was hoping that was going to be the next role,\" she says, \"prior to the current political climate.\"\nAs she approached her 50th birthday last summer, Byrdsong Williams was pretty close to the top of her chosen field; her most recent job title was \"global director of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\" But now, \"chief diversity officer\" seems like a promotion that will never happen — for her, and for thousands of U.S. workers.\nThe anti-DEI \"political climate\" Byrdsong Williams refers to has been slowly bubbling up for years — even before President Trump was re-elected, and set things to a hard boil by immediately signing executive orders banning whathe calls \"illegal DEI.\"Now scores of employers are inall-out retreatfrom anything adjacent to the word \"diversity\" — including the experienced DEI specialists who wereonce in high demand.\nFor example, just this monthVerizon announced it was endingmany of its DEI policies, as it sought the Federal Communications Commission's blessing for a $20 billion merger. It promised the agency that itshuman-resources department\"will no longer have a team or any individual roles focused on DEI.\"\nThis retreat is decimating the job market for people like Byrdsong Williams. Since early 2023, U.S. employers have eliminated more than 2,600 jobs with words including \"diversity\" or \"DEI\" in the titles or descriptions, according to a data analysis conducted for NPR by the workforce analytics firm Revelio Labs.\nLoading...\nThat accounts for about 13% of the DEI-related jobs that existed in early 2023, at the peak of the hiring boom, NPR is the first to report. Now that boom has shifted firmly into reverse.\nA man visits a makeshift memorial honoring George Floyd on May 26, 2020 in Minneapolis.Kerem Yücel/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nThis Sunday, May 25, marked the fifth anniversary ofGeorge Floyd's murderby awhite police officerandthe start of a national reckoningover systemic racism. Corporate Americarushed to join in, loudly proclaiming that businesses should and woulddo moreto fight discrimination andcreate more opportunitiesfor workers of all backgrounds.\nHowever superficialsome of these promises turned out to be, big companies spent a lot of money on them — and hired thousands to implement them. By early 2023,  U.S. companies employed more than 20,000 people focused on DEI.That was more than double the number of such jobs five years earlier, according to Revelio Labs' analysis of 8.8 million employers.\nBut almost as soon as companies had staffed up these DEI teams, they faced a backlash — from conservativeinfluencers, activists,lawyers, and state and federal officials. These critics argue that DEIis itself discriminatory, and thatemployers have added barriers for white people, especially white men, to get jobs or promotions, even if they are the most qualified candidates.\nThe DEI backlash really started gaining steam in 2023, when the Supreme Courtstruck down affirmative actionat colleges and universities. That same year, Bud Lightlost more than $1 billion in salesdue to aconservative boycott, after it hired atransgender influencerfor a brief promotional video.\nThen, within hours of his second inauguration, Trumpramped up the attacks with his executive orders. Hecalledthe programs \"radical and wasteful\" and discriminatory against non-minorities who,he said, are denied opportunities and recognition. Since then, his administration hasdeclared open waron diversity programs fromgovernment agenciestouniversities,law firms,cultural institutionsandmore.\nPresident Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office on Inauguration Day.Jim Watson/Pool/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption\nNow more big companies are fleeing the field.Walmart,Target,Amazon, and Metaare just a few of the mega-employers that have ended some of their DEI policies in the past six months, as dozens of othersscrubbed words like \"diversity\"from even their driest public documents.\nThat's having a crushing professional impact on people like Byrdsong Williams, who was laid off even before Trump was elected, and who now has to contend with a job market that is both smaller and more crowded. She's more than nine months into her search.\n\"It's been pretty tough,\" she says. \"I just didn't think it would take this long.\"\nThe day-to-day work of making employers more inclusive tends to be — like most human resources work — both important andincredibly mundane.\nPeople in these jobs generally manage the practical logistics of trying to create workplaces that are more welcoming for all employees — and more attractive to a broader pool of qualified candidates.\nByrdsong Williams, for example, has created mentoring programs so that workers who don't come from the same schools or backgrounds as a company's top executives still have an opportunity to learn from them — and network. She's developed resource groups to give underrepresented workers a better peer support system. She's helped employers expand their recruiting efforts for new hires, for example by spending more time at historically Black colleges and universities.\nByrdsong Williams is one of the thousands of U.S. workers who specialize in the field of diversity, equity, and inclusion, or \"DEI,\" who now face a difficult job market following Corporate America's abrupt reversal on these positions.Cornell Watson for NPRhide caption\nThis kind of work benefits most employers because it makes it easier to hire and retain good employees. Even some of the companies who are ending their DEI policies acknowledge this: \"Delivering for customers requires attracting the best talent from across the country,\" Verizontold the FCC this month, adding that it remains \"committed to creating a culture that leverages and values each person's unique strengths and talents.\"\nVerizon is in good company: Many of the employers retreating from DEI have said that they \"remain committed to creating a culture where everyone can be successful,\" as a Walmart spokespersontold NPR. And in some cases, they've renamed diversity initiatives with more generic terms.TargetandWalmartnow talk about \"belonging,\" while Meta's one-time chief diversity officernow overseessomething called \"accessibility and engagement.\"\nSome big companies, includingCostcoandDelta Air Lines, are publicly defending their DEI initiatives (and the language they use to discuss them). Investors inApple, Levi's, and othershave shrugged off anti-DEI shareholder proposals this spring.\nAnd some business and workplace experts say that even the companies that have announced DEI retreats are mostly making superficial and semantic changes, whileremaining committedto the underlying goals of creating more opportunities for all workers.\nBut they're not hiring as many people to do this work anymore, whatever it's called. Revelio Labs reports that companies are now more likely to post jobs that mention \"belonging,\" \"social impact\" or \"culture\" — but even those have fallen significantly from 2022.\nLoading...\n\"There is still more demand for DEI roles and similar roles than we saw at the beginning of 2020 — but it does look like these are trending to reach levels back to where we all started,\" says Paulina Tilly, a data scientist at Revelio Labs who conducted the analysis for NPR.\nMeanwhile, chief diversity officers have been resigning, retiring or getting laid off — and they arenot being replaced. (This includes at NPR, which has not named another chief diversity officer since Keith Woodsretired this spring. NPR has said it \"remains committed to serving a diverse workforce,\" and spokesperson Heather Walls says via email that NPR's remaining Office of Diversity personnel will now report to its chief operating officer, \"as part of broader strategic changes to NPR's senior leadership structure.\")\nExecutive recruiters confirm that they're seeing a slowdown in companies seeking chief diversity officers and other top executives. \"It's a challenging time to be in diversity, equity and inclusion work,\" says Yen Ling Shek of Russell Reynolds Associates, a global recruiting and advisory firm.\nAll of this leaves veterans like Byrdsong Williams, with nearly two decades of experience in what she calls \"my heart's work,\" facing prolonged unemployment. There's also her fear and pain at seeing her profession publicly vilified.\n\"I just want a company to see me,\" she says. \"Which is really ironic — because part of DEI is being seen and being heard.\"\nByrdsong Williams's home office features a painting of a favorite Bible verse made by her daughter.Cornell Watson for NPRhide caption\nWith DEI under attack, many in corporate America stopped talking about it. Theomertahas left many people working in diversity feeling isolated, worried about their employment prospects — and terrified of discussing it in public.\nBut in February, after multiple job interviews went nowhere, Byrdsong Williams decided to speak out. Sheposted on LinkedInabout her layoff, how \"fewer DEI roles exist due to the political climate,\" and how she's trying to take time to \"breathe, enjoy life and reflect\" while job hunting.\n\"The world has taken a step back, in just the narrative, overnight. It's been crazy,\" she said in late March, at her home in a leafy rural suburb near Raleigh.\nByrdsong Williams grew up in the area; she studied occupational health in college and lived part-time in Europe with her then-husband as they started a family. But when her marriage ended, Byrdsong Williams settled back home with her three daughters, who are now young adults.\nIn 2007, she started a claims adjuster job for Nationwide, the insurance company — but her degree and early experience working in human resources caught an executive's eye. Soon, Byrdsong Williams was asked to help start up a regional program focused on what was then called \"diversity and inclusion,\" or \"D&I.\"\nShe recalls leading one meeting with a colleague who didn't seem to be paying attention to what she was saying. But her professional irritation melted once she learned the cause of the seeming disrespect: Her colleague was partially deaf, and struggling to lip-read Byrdsong Williams' usual rapid cadence.\nThat experience made her realize that \"diversity runs so deep. It's not only about the things that you can see.\"\n\"I remember getting excited,\" she recalls. \"It became my life's mission at that point.\"\n\"I just want to do good work until it's time for me to retire,\" Byrdsong Williams says.Cornell Watson for NPRhide caption\nAs she gained more experience, bigger employers started calling. She worked for tech giant Cisco and the software startup GitLab, which hired her to oversee \"diversity, inclusion, and belonging\" as it got ready to go public in 2021. (That IPO also gave her a decent stock payday, which she says has become a financial cushion during her unemployment.)\nBy 2021, corporate America was hitting Peak DEI, and Byrdsong Williams was fielding weekly calls or emails from recruiters. \"My inbox was completely on fire,\" she recalls.\nToday, it's in a deep freeze. Byrdsong Williams was laid off by her most recent employer, a private software startup, in early August. Since then, she has interviewed for two separate jobs where, after several rounds of interviews, she was told that the company was no longer hiring to fill the position. In one case, she saw the company later post a similar job description — with no reference to diversity, equity, or inclusion.\n\"I don't understand how it has come to a place of just taboo: 'Don't talk about it,'\" she says.\nAsked if she's given up on her dream of becoming a chief diversity officer, Byrdsong Williams paused for several seconds, fighting back tears.\n\"I'm not chasing the title,\" she said. \"I just want to do good work until it's time for me to retire.\"\nThose who work in DEI acknowledge that the profession's goals haven't always been well-defined at every employer. Some companies havedamaged its reputationby treating DEI  as a superficial buzzword, or by promisingshort-term financial benefitsthat never materialized, or bymaking ambitious promiseswithout thinking through what it would cost to fulfill them.\n\"Companies often spent too much time and energy on initiatives that didn't have a measurable impact,\" says Joelle Emerson, CEO of workplace consultancy Paradigm.\n\"I've seen companies focus on initiatives that made them look super progressive, for example, while still failing to do basic things — like ensuring promotion practices are fair, or improving hiring processes so that people from all backgrounds are evaluated fairly,\" she adds.\nBut on the whole, many working in DEI argue that critics who call it discriminatoryare fundamentally — and often willfully — misinterpreting their profession.\n\"The work of inclusion and diversity is actually making the workplace better for most people, without giving — and without taking — anything away from anyone,\" says Jeffrey Siminoff, a longtime executive who created and ran such initiatives for Morgan Stanley, Apple and Twitter.\nSiminoff was an employment lawyer at Morgan Stanley in 2010 when he was asked to take over running its \"inclusion and diversity\" program. He was also, he says, a one-time \"closeted gay man\" who had spent his early career worried that his identity would prevent him from advancing professionally. Siminoff says that fear distracted him from fully focusing on his job or performing at his best.\nGetting involved in Morgan Stanley's resource group for LGBTQ employees was a game-changer. \"On a personal level, it was like this boulder had been pulled off of each shoulder,\" he says.\n\"Those opportunities existed not to give me a leg up over somebody else,\" he adds, \"but to simply allow me to do my best work, unburdened by silly things that didn't need to be there.\"\nAs Siminoff points out, many people who specialize in diversity work have some lived experience with feeling marginalized in corporate America. Black women like Byrdsong Williams, for example,hold fewer than 3%of the top \"C-Suite\" executive jobs in corporate America, even though they account fornearly 8%of the U.S. population.\nFor a few years, the DEI hiring boom offered more opportunities. According to Revelio Labs, women accounted for more than 71% of all DEI professionals from 2020 through 2024 — compared with 51% of other roles. Black and Hispanic workers together held only 21% of other jobs — but 33% of DEI roles.\nLoading...\nMoreover, companies that remain committed to diversity do in fact tend to hire a more diverse workforce, especially Black and Asian workers, than companies without DEI teams, Revelio Labs found.\nThat means that corporate America's DEI retreat is having an outsized impact on underrepresented employees — both the executives who run these initiatives, and the more diverse workforces they helped create.\n\"Getting rid of these DEI functions is really going to pare back the diversity of the workplace, even to be felt years from now,\" says Tilly.\nWhile some DEI employees hope their work will continue under names such as \"belonging\" or \"cultural transformation,\" Tilly sees a drop-off in those job titles too.\n\"It looks like a lot of the roles that they're moving into are just going to be more generalist [human resources] roles,\" she says.\nSome veteran DEI executives are figuring out if they want to stick with the embattled field — or focus on something else. Siminoff, who's been consulting since leaving the nonprofit Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights last year, says it's a tough time for his profession.\n\"Doing this work right now is particularly complicated,\" he says. \"And I'm just not sure that doing it, with all of this uncertainty, is something that I would choose right now.\"\nByrdsong Williams is trying to keep the faith. She's applying for roles in \"people\" and \"cultural transformation,\" and hoping that soon, an employer will look beyond the now-politicized buzzwords on her resume.\nShe's had a lot of practice staying positive over the last several months — including during her long-planned 50th birthday party last August, which she hosted a few weeks after being laid off.\nIt was a bittersweet bash. Byrdsong Williams invited more than 100 loved ones toan art museumin downtown Raleigh. Most of them didn't know about her job loss, and she didn't want to let it overshadow the evening. Instead, she put on a shimmering chartreuse dress and made a grand entrance dancing to Carl Carlton's 1981 funk classic \"She's a Bad Mama Jama.\"\n\"I'm dancing, I'm having a moment, but I'm like — only a few in this room know that I don't have a job,\" she recalls. \"Is this really happening?\"\nByrdsong Williams holds a booklet she received from her daughters at her 50th birthday party.Cornell Watson for NPRhide caption\nDuring an overcast afternoon this spring, Byrdsong Williams returned to the museum where she hosted that party. There was a new exhibit up: bright, joyous, larger-than-life paintings, mostly of Black children playing. It was called \"The Power of Community.\"\nByrdsong Williams stopped in front of one canvas, of a child crouched on a ledge, seemingly getting ready to jump. The painting, by Lamar Whidbee, was titled \"Leap of Faith I.\"\n\"I love that,\" she murmured, reading the title aloud. \"Those are some words that I feel right now.\"",

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the changesin a memo Friday. The new policies vastly limit access for credentialed media while inside the Pentagon complex in Arlington, Va.\nThe restrictions ban reporters and other media from many areas of the Pentagon unless they're accompanied by an approved government escort. The restricted areas include the offices of Hegseth, his top aides, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nMembers of the press covering the U.S. military have historically had access to these newly restricted areas through past Republican and Democratic presidential administrations.\nHegseth, a former FOX News host, said in the memo that the Pentagon is adopting the new media policies to protect national security:\n\"While the Department remains committed to transparency, the Department is equally obligated to protect [classified national intelligence information] and sensitive information — the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. Service members in danger.\"\nThe Pentagon Press Association, an organization independent from the U.S. government that represents journalists who cover the military, expressed deep concern in a statement shared with NPR.\n\"There is no way to sugarcoat it,\" PPA's board of directors said in the statement. \"Today's memo by Secretary Hegseth appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what its military is doing.\"\nThe National Press Club is urging the Pentagon to swiftly reverse course. The organization's President Mike Balsamo saidin a statement Friday, \"Restricting access doesn't protect national security. It undermines public trust.\"\nThe restrictions are the latest step by the White House to limit access for journalists and to tightly control the news reporting of journalists covering the Trump administration. In January, the Defense Department vacated several major news outlets from their dedicated workspaces at the Pentagon,including NPR. The following month,the White House revokedthe White House Correspondents' Association's ability to decide how media outlets share coverage of President Trump at major events where space is limited.\nHegseth has faced criticism after twicesharing sensitive military planson his private phone through the Signal messaging app. Then-National Security Advisor Michael Waltz mistakenly included a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg,editor-in-chief ofThe AtlanticMagazine, in one of the text chains.\nHegseth's memo on the new restrictions says journalists will be required to complete a form \"explaining their responsibilities\" and receive a new credential and badge with \"clearer\" press identifiers in the coming weeks.

        "content": "Rubbing rendered animal fat into your skin might sound gross, but beef tallow has become a trendy skin care product that some claim can clear up acne, is great for dry skin, and even makes you look younger.\nTallow is fat that has been slowly melted, strained and then hardened into a waxy paste. Often used incooking, all sorts of animal fats — goat, swan, even lion — have also been used as a cosmetics ingredient since antiquity, says historian Susan Stewart.\nNow, in 2025, some people are embracing beef tallow as a \"natural\" skincare choice. On TikTok, hundreds of videos with millions of views discuss or promote tallow products. Brands like Good Ol' Days Tallow Co., Evil Goods!, Betr4you and HolyCow appear again and again, from a raft of creators who earn commission for every jar of tallow they convince someone else to buy.\nIn one TikTik from the account@ItsColleensShop, a woman drips her finger into a jar of the brand Good Ol' Days Tallow Co. and then licks it before telling the camera, \"If you can't eat your skin care, then you shouldn't be putting it on your face.\"\nVideosfrom otheraccountsselling otherbrandsof tallow say the same,almost verbatim.\nThough Good O' Days Tallow says it comes from grass-fed cows, not everything edible is good for the skin, dermatologists warn.\nThe claim:Beef tallow is a superior, natural skin lotion that can give you clear, glowing and youthful skin.\nThe evidence:Tallow's not total snake oil. Your skin may look plump and dewy after applying it, says Marisa Plescia, vice president of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists and founder FemChem Beauty. That's because, as a saturated fat, tallow has a high lipid content and these fatty compounds create a sort of barrier that locks in moisture.\nHowever, other products, including shea butter and olive oil, also contain lipids that create the same effect.\n\"Beef tallow is not any different, really, than any other plant oil that's out there,\" says Plescia.\nAnd there are way better options for moisturizing your skin than cooking oils, Plescia says. The lotions that chemists formulate include humectants, such as glycerine and hyaluronic acid, which attract and bind to water to keep your skin moist. Plain fats don't have those.\nThe risks:WhilesomeTikTok creators claim thattallowhas cleared up theircomplexion, beef fat can actually make acne worse, warns Dr. Delila Foulad, a board-certified dermatologist at UCLA Health, who specializes in treating skin and scalp disorders\n\"Beef tallow is essentially a lipid, or an oil. Putting that on your skin could clog your pores,\" she tells NPR.\nThere's also a chance of an allergic reaction, similar to how some people's skin reacts to jewelry that contains nickel. Those withpsoriasis or eczema should be extra cautious of tallow since their skin barrier is already compromised, says Foulad.\nThings that you apply on the skin \"can cause a secondary allergic contact dermatitis, which is basically a skin allergy,\" Foulad says.\nFor people who still want to try it, she recommends they start with a patch test: Put tallow on just a small area of the skin and wait a couple of weeks before slathering everywhere.\n\"If you are going to have a reaction, it's not something that usually happens right away,\" she says.\nAlso, this animal fat can go rancid over time, especially in hot weather. So keep it in the fridge.\nUnlike tallow, traditionally formulated lotions and moisturizers contain antioxidants that prevent decomposition, or spoilage, explains Plescia.\nWhat's behind the trend:Tallow can seem like a more pure option compared to lab-made beauty products that contain ingredients with chemically-sounding names, such as phenoxyethanol and C13-14 isoparaffin.\nAnd the U.S. is having a cultural moment where people are skeptical of synthetic ingredients, says Jennifer Reich, a sociologist at the University of Colorado Denver who researches how people make health and wellness decisions.\n\"That is a backswing, to corporate developments of things like food and household products that have often had ingredients that have not been particularly safe or have environmental impacts,\" she says.\nNPR haspreviously reportedthat certain substances found in some gels, lotions and creams can be harmful to reproductive health, or contain carcinogens. And, in March, theFood and Drug Administration announceda voluntary recall of acne products for possible benzene contamination, which is a carcinogen\nAs a sort of shortcut to healthier choices, Reich says people opt for things like beef tallow that seem natural because it ostensibly comes from a farm instead of an opaque supply chain of overseas factories.\nTallow seems to have a special appeal for men, notes Jordan Foster, a sociologist at Alberta's MacEwan University.\nRed meat haslong-standing associationswith masculinity: cowboys, cavemen,Ron Swanson. So when men use beef tallow, Foster says they're aligning with those relatively narrow gender scripts, while still participating in a traditionally feminine domain of skincare.\nOne TikToker@mercercaidensaid that he uses a whipped tallow cream as an aftershave and to moisturize his knuckles.\n\"I feel younger already,\" he said as he rubbed what looked like a tablespoon's worth of fat into his face.\nThe bottom line:Tallow balm probably won't hurt you much (though acne and eczema sufferers beware), but watch out for claims that it's better just because it's natural.\nThough understandable, Reich says this feeds into a larger trend of rejecting science and warns that information on social media can lack nuance or result in dangerous choices, such as drinking unpasteurized milk or trying unproven medical treatments.\nNot every ingredient with a long name is necessarily dangerous but if you want to avoid those that are linked to possible health problems,here are a handfulthat scientists are especially concerned about.\nBut Reich says this systemic problem of lax regulations cannot be solved on the individual level, regardless of how hard a person works to figure out which products are safe: \"These are really taxing decisions to make every day. They exhaust people.\"\nThe best course of action, says Foulad, is to consult with a dermatologist who should be up to date on the latest research and can help you select products that will work well for your skin.",

Even as their lives were upended by the floods, they could count on getting a free supply of the anti-retroviral drugs they need to suppress the virus and stay healthy — supplied by the U.S.\nLoading...\nBut in the wake of the Trump Administration's dramatic aid cutbacks, the women say they are seeing changes that make them anxious about the future — despite U.S. assurances that the supply of drugs will not be interrupted.\nAlice Akinyi, a No Sex For Fish member, waits to take a boat to Nduru Beach to get the latest catch from the fishermen to sell — roads were damaged by past floods so it's hard to get to the shore these days. She's one of only two members whose fishing boats are still functioning. The lower half of the house behind her — the area that's darker — was underwater during the peak of the flooding. The structure is no longer habitable.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nRebbeccah Atieno is a No Sex for Fish member who is HIV positive. A single mom with six kids, she lost her home in Nduru Beach to the floods and now lives in a house she had temporarily borrowed from a fellow villager who was not affected by the flood waters. But that neighbor expects her to move out from the house in August and find her own place.\nTheir former village is now more like an island, cut off by the flood waters. But Atieno still returns — either by hiring a boat for $1 or wading through deep water — to meet fishermen who use one of the No Sex group's two surviving boats and obtain a catch she can sell to earn money for food and school fees.\nWhile scaling a piece of tilapia with a blunt knife, she shares her worries.\nRebbeccah Atieno, a No Sex For Fish member, scales and guts the fish she bought from fellow member Alice Akinyi at Nduru Beach, getting them ready to sell.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nShe says that up until this year she thought her major struggle would be \"the displacement from my home\" because of the flooding — and earning a living.\nNow she has an additional worry: Will she be able to get the antiretroviral drugs she needs to suppress the HIV virus and stay healthy?\n\"They used to give me ARVs of up to 6 months but that has currently reduced to only one month,\" she says, referring to the clinic that distributes the drugs. It's an hour's walk each way, and now she must make more frequent trips — an additional hardship in the hard life of a working single mother.\n\"We are scared of what the future holds,\" she says.\nRebbeccah Atieno (left) sits inside her current home, along with No Sex For Fish chairwoman Justine Adhiambo Obura and fellow member Naomy Akoth.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nSo what did happen exactly? There are conflicting narratives.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly said that the supply of life-saving drugs would not be affected by the dramatic reduction in foreign aid.\nBut according to Dr. Fredrick Oluoch, the director of public health in Kisumu County, where Otieno lives, the U.S. cutbacks have caused interruptions in the supply chain that gets drugs into the hands of those who need them.\nIt's a complicated situation, explains a source who previously worked for PEPFAR, the U.S. agency that targets HIV prevention and who spoke on the condition of anonymity \"to avoid professional or institutional pushback that could prevent me from speaking further.\"\nThe source said that a number of USAID contracts in Kenya and elsewhere that covered anti-retroviral medications were halted and \"took a while to restart.\"\nWhat's more, some clinics relied on U.S.-funded programs to get the drugs to the clinics where they are handed out. And the government has stated that some 41,000 health workers lost their U.S.-funded jobs in the wake of the aid cutback.\n\"The ability to access and deliver HIV medications was interrupted due to clinic closures, firing tens of thousands of health care workers, and interruptions in supply chain delivery,\" the source says.\nThe government has pledged to continue the distribution of these vital drugs, has since rehired many of the people who lost their jobs and has urged the public not to be afraid. But it has not provided a full explanation of how patients will again be able to get a larger supply of drugs at one visit.\nSo even though there does not appear to be a shortage of anti-retroviral drugs in Kenya at this time, there is tremendous uncertainty, the source says. As a result, some clinics are hoarding the drugs they do have. This hoarding may also reflect the mindset in Kenya of a few years ago, when there was an actual shortage of anti-HIV drugs.\n\"People are telling me that they're moving toward solutions,\" the former PEPFAR employee said. \"But if you're the woman who is a day wage earner and have to figure out a way to go every two weeks to get your care when you were going every six months, I'm sure it's upsetting and disturbing.\"\n\"There is a lot of anxiety, stress, depression among even the HIV patients because they don't know the future,\" says Oluoch. \"They don't know whether they are going to get their medication.\"\nErick Okioma, an advocate for people with HIV, believes the Kenyan government should address any gaps in funding for HIV services caused by U.S. aid cuts.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nIn response to an inquiry from NPR, a U.S. State Department spokesperson noted that \"PEPFAR-funded programs that deliver HIV care and treatment or prevention of mother to child transmission services are operational for a majority [of] beneficiaries.\n\"All other PEPFAR-funded services, including those provided by other agencies, are currently being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy. PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time if it achieves its mission. We are enhancing service delivery efficiency and advancing PEPFAR partner countries toward self-reliance.\"\nErick Okioma, an HIV activist and the team leader for the Nelson Mandela TB, HIV Information organization, has been living with HIV for 20 years, believes the cuts are a wake-up call to the government.\n\"I am definitely worried because the quality of services is going to go down. I can say that unless something is done, we might go back many years. Many years back,\" he says, referring to the not-so-distant past. According to the Ministry of Health, since 2010, Kenya has reduced new HIV infections by more than 67%, from 101,000 cases in 2010 to 16,752 infections in 2024.\nThe women of No Sex for Fish know all too well how dangerous HIV can be without preventive pills.\nRose Atieno Abongo, a mother of six who was HIV positive, died last October — before the aid upheaval of 2025 worries. Yet her death is a reminder of how critical the anti-HIV medications are.\nJack Len'go holds a photo of his wife, Rose Atieno Abongo, who was a member of the No Sex for Fish group. The photo was taken in 2019, when an NPR team first reported on this story. Rose died in October 2024 of complications from HIV/AIDS. Len'go says she'd stopped taking her preventive drugs because she was not getting proper nutrition and the pills were making her sick. Rose is buried next to their home.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nHer husband, Jack, says that the family couldn't afford decent meals as their income from selling fish disappeared. He says Rose would sometimes vomit after taking her drugs, So eventually, she stopped taking the antiretrovirals. She gave up on life, he says. She developed respiratory problems and a kidney infection, he says, and died of AIDS.\nJack is HIV positive as well. \"I have also been taking my drugs from health center,\" he says — that's the Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital. But he worries: Will clinics run out of pills? He has a teenage daughter who is also HIV positive. She keeps asking how long there will be medication for her and her dad.\n\"I have been trying my best to assure the child that all will be well but it is not easy. The fear and anxiety is real,\" he says.\nNaomy Akoth, who's 42, also has fears about when and how she will get her next dose of ARV drugs.\nNaomy Akoth must walk 40 minutes each way to get her supply of HIV preventive drugs. Since the U.S. aid cuts the clinic is distributing fewer pills at each visit, causing her to worry.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nLike most of the HIV positive women from the No Sex for Fish group, she picks up her drugs at  Nyang'ande hospital — a 40-minute walk each way from the temporary housing she found after being displaced by the floods.\nAdding to her worries is the difficulty earning money to care for her seven children. With the fishing boat that she'd once had now gone, she says, \"My small hotel business barely makes three dollars in a day,\" she says. And she worries that someday she will have to pay for the HIV medications — although at this time the government has pledged to continue distributing free pills.\n\"It is our prayer that the government will do something to avert a crisis,\" she says.\nAkoth contracted the disease after her husband died in 2002 and, pressured by local tradition to marry again so a man could take care of her family, she wed a fisherman who was HIV positive.\nIt is a decision she regrets but she says there was nothing much she could have done to avoid this fate. She has since separated from her husband.\nDr. Theresa Opiyo of Nyang'ande Sub-County Hospital, Kisumu, says that patients with HIV now need counseling to cope with their fears that the supply of drugs to suppress the virus might be affected by U.S. aid cuts. So far the impact has been that patients get fewer pills when they visit — perhaps a supply for one month rather than for half a year.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nTheresa Opiyo, a doctor at the Nyang'ande health facility who supports HIV patients, says she is now counseling patients who are worried about the future. \"The withdrawal of support has had a significant negative impact and has caused stress and unanswered questions,\" says Opiyo. She adds that she too is feeling stress from all the uncertainties.\nAnd it's not just the distribution of medication that's on her mind. Opiyo says that educational programs aimed at educating the public about HIV transmission have been put on hold due to aid cuts. \"Through the program, we were able to prevent the spread of HIV among adolescents,\" she says. \"The impact was huge because it also helped reduce mother-to-child transmission.\"\nJustine Obura, the chairperson of the No Sex For Fish Group, says the group members are trying to support each other.\n\"We have also been able to maintain a table banking platform that enables us to save and share,\" she says.\nNo Sex For Fish member Naomy Akoth makes notes during a \"table banking\" session. Members contribute to a pool of money; those in need can ask for a loan.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\n\"Table banking\" is the term for an informal savings association. Members who are able to earn money — from selling fish, from growing vegetables — contribute regularly. Members who need cash can ask for a loan with the expectation that they'll eventually repay it. Sometimes the request is for cash to cover the cost of a cab to get to the clinic where they pick up their antiretroviral drugs.\nThey meet at Justine Obura's home. After the floods of 2020 wiped out much of their village, she used her savings to buy land about 5 miles from Nduru Beach, where she built a house and now raises vegetables to earn income.\nAlice Akinyi at Justine Obura's home just before a Sunday \"table banking\" session.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nAlice Akinyi Amonde is one of two members who still has a functioning boat. She herself is not HIV positive but says she and others offer both moral and financial support when possible, paying for transportation to reach a clinic that will provide the drugs they need.\nBut she admits that her own financial prospects are far from secure. \"The income is low because the catch keeps dwindling,\" says Amonde.\nThe women of No Sex for Fish gather for a Sunday \"table banking\" session to collect contributions and assess requests for loans. They're meeting at Justine Obura's home.Julia Gunther for NPRhide caption\nIn spite of the uncertainty they face, these women are still bold planners. Obura says they hope to get help from a donor to start farming rice and for other agricultural endeavors.\nYet it can be hard to hold on to hope.\n\"We are living a daily nightmare,\" says Rebbeccah Atieno. \"Hope is diminishing every day for our members. But we are still holding on, praying that the floods will recede and the uninterrupted supply of vital life-saving drugs will resume.\"\nViola Kosome is a Kenyan journalist.

        "title": "A disabled mom's message to parents: We all need help, and it's OK to ask for it",
        "content": "Jessica Slice with her two children.Liz Cooperhide caption\nIn 2011, Jessica Slice took a strenuous summer hike on the Greek Island of Santorini. She didn't drink enough water and when she returned to her cruise ship, she felt dizzy and nauseated.\nShe thought it would pass but her symptoms got worse, making it hard for Slice to stand upright without fainting. And they didn't go away.\nAfter years of tests, doctors' appointments, rehabilitation programs, and frustration, Slice was eventually diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome,or POTS,an autonomic nervous system disorder.\nShe eventually embrace a new identity: a person with a disability. Becoming disabled radically changed her life, in ways that she says are both difficult and empowering.\nThen she became a mom.\nSlice's new book,Unfit Parent: A Disabled Mother Challenges An Inaccessible World,chronicles her experiences as a parent with a disability, first as an adoptive parent and then as a biological parent via gestational surrogacy.\nLike many parenting memoirs, her book is full of diaper explosions, Googling \"how to take care of a newborn,\" and moments of tenderness. But her story is also defined by physical and emotional challenges that forced her to embrace depending on others.\nAnd that willingness to ask for help, Slice argues, is something all parents — disabled or not — can learn from. Slice offers a perspective from the world of disability justice, a movement that fights against \"corrosive perfectionism\" and instead advocates for mutual aid, infrastructure that welcomes all bodies, and stronger social safety nets.\n\"Every parent I know feels like they are one logistical hiccup away from a breakdown,\" she writes. \"How did we get here? Why does parenting feel like an impossible feat that threatens to destroy any person who takes it on?\"\nSlice spoke with NPR about her book. Their conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nYou argue that parenting is about accepting a loss of control. As much as they might like to, parents cannot make their kids do what they want. How did becoming disabled help you come to accept this?\nI am, by nature and nurture and being an eldest daughter, a very controlling person. I was that way to an extreme in my 20s. I had this feeling that my own effort could make me happy if I only figured out how to do things well enough: Work hard and eat the right things and plan the perfect week every week. I just thought there was perfection attainable and that I would find satisfaction there. I never understood why I felt like I was crumbling inside. I had this deep, deep kind of dissatisfaction.\nAt 28, I became disabled. My onset was so sudden and changed my life so profoundly in the course of a day. It took years to accept that I was sick, that I was disabled, and that I would never be well again. In that process, the sense that a good life was within my own power had been taken from me.\nSo when I became a parent, after becoming disabled, I no longer put pressure on myself as a parent to do everything right. I also don't put pressure on my kids to do everything right. In many ways, my parenting is limited, because I can do a lot less physically than I could before. I mean, dramatically less. But there's something really foundational: I am okay with life not being perfect or beautiful according to all my expectations, and I'm okay with my kids not being those things either. Although, of course, my kids are beautiful.\nOur cultural ideas of perfection are often related to capitalism, which gives us the idea we should be productive and independent and not rely on anyone else for any kind of help. What are some examples of how this mindset shift shows up in your parenting?\nI don't track [developmental] milestones for my kids. I can't even remember when my first child did anything. I hold this so loosely it doesn't stick in my brain. I believe that if my kids need additional support, I will know because I'm an attentive, involved parent. I don't really care when they're supposed to do things. I'm not always worried about when they will crawl, when they will say a word, or put a thing in a bucket. When they do things, it's very funny and delightful. We have a baby now, and every new thing he does is a shock.\nI don't think milestones writ large are a bad idea, but I think within a certain highly competitive, perfectionistic population — largely higher income — milestones are this anxiety-inducing thing.\nThe milestones are only one example. Releasing control, or this sense that there's a rightness that we need to be aligning with as much as possible, has given me a sense of freedom. I'm not watching my kids, waiting for them to be right or wrong.\nOur safety net in the U.S. is so weak, it feels scary that we might need to rely on it. But parenting is, by definition, caring for a vulnerable person. Why is disability so stigmatized in our culture, while parenting is praised?\nThat's why parenting can feel so jarring. It's this lauded milestone, but when it happens, it hits on something kind of primal: This isn't safe, this isn't good, because there's this interdependence in parenting. When you become a parent, you are entering into a system where you need care. If you're the one who gave birth, certainly, but no matter what, parents always need help. You cannot do every single part of it on your own, and so you become dependent.\nAnd so I think part of why parenting can feel so difficult is because it's a relationship, even unknowingly, with disability. We're terrified of disability. Disability is equated with mortality. And the last thing we want to think about with parenting is that we're fragile, that we're mortal.\nNon-disabled people have so much pressure to be invincible: you shouldn't need care, you shouldn't be needy, shouldn't mess up, this shouldn't be hard. If we weren't so scared of disability, then we could fully admit each of our relationships with fragility. When you care with an acceptance of limited capacity, it leaves us open for so much more joy, but also just so much honesty about the experiences we're actually having.\nYou write about the horrific ways that people with disabilities have been treated by the U.S. health care system: institutionalization, forced sterilization, denial of care. And you personally have had doctors act as gatekeepers around your \"fitness\" to become a parent.What would justice and equity for people with disabilities look like in reproductive health care?\nJustice for disabled people starts very young and goes all the way through. Disabled people are often excluded from or don't have access to inclusive sexual education. And they experience sexual assault at a greater frequency than non-disabled people. Disabled people are much less likely to receive a pregnancy test than a non-disabled person. And a lot of obstetricians and gynecologists don't have accessible [clinics] and training for treating disabled people.\nThe majority of doctors would prefer to not work with disabled people,according to Dr. Lisa Iezzoni's research. We take so much time and energy and manpower, and doctors are operating in a system that does not allow for that in order to get paid.\nDisabled people are often counseled to not reproduce, lest we produce another disabled child. Our second child was born via surrogacy, and people said to me, \"Aren't you going to make sure the baby doesn't have your disability?\" And I was like, \"Well, I really like my life.\" I don't think that should be the assumption, that we wouldn't want another person with the life I'm living.\nGetting a power wheelchair transformed your life. How did parenting change for you once you started using one?\nI can stand for about 30 seconds to a minute before I become very symptomatic and start to black out. I can sit upright, unsupported, for three to five minutes. And for the first seven years I was disabled, I truly never considered a power wheelchair. I just thought that the world available to me was the world that I could access if I never had to stand more than 30 seconds.\nThen when my daughter was one and started doing more stuff out of the house that I couldn't join her for, like going to the playground and a ballet class, I just really wasn't satisfied missing them. And then I looked into a power wheelchair.\nIt changed my life. I can go places now. I can be in the world with my kids, but also do my own things. I can go for long walks. I can go inside stores. I get to be in the world again. And now the thing that's limiting is: Where can a wheelchair go and not go? I think people feel very sad for me when they see me in a wheelchair. But it's actually so much more joyful for me than when I didn't have one.\nMara Gordon is a family physician at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University  and a contributor to NPR.

They drank coffee and returned to the breakfast bar for seconds on pastries\nA quick round of trivia gets everyone's minds working.\n\"We start out with just little trivia, many of us cannot answer any of the questions,\" Kennedy said with a laugh.\n\"We all have a good time going around,\" he added. \"You know, we all try to make it fun.\"\nThis memory cafe in northeast Pennsylvania is one ofmore than 600across the country. These gatherings for people with cognitive impairment and their caregivers are relatively cheap and easy to run — often the only expense is a small rental fee for the space.\nAs state and local health departments nationwide try to make sense of what the potential loss of$11 billion of federal health fundingwill mean for the services they can offer their communities, memory cafe organizers believe their work may become even more important.\nAs things get underway at the memory cafe in Clarks Summit, Penn., guests help themselves to breakfast pastries.Aimee Dilger/WVIA Newshide caption\nKennedy's diagnosis forced him to retire, ending a decades' long career as asoftware engineerat theUniversity of Scranton.\nHe recommends memory cafes to other people with dementia and their families.\n\"If they're not coming to a place like this, they're doing themselves a disservice. You got to get out there and see people that are laughing.\"\nThe memory cafes happen twice a month. They have given him purpose, Kennedy said, and help him cope with negative emotions around his diagnosis.\n\"I came in and I was miserable,\" Kennedy said. \"I come in now and it's like, it's family, it's a big, extended family. I get to meet them. I get to meet their partners. I get to meet their children. So, it's really nice.\"\nMore thansix million peoplein the U.S. have been diagnosed with some form of dementia. The diagnosis can be burdensome on relationships, particularly with family members who are the primary caregivers.\nA new report from theAlzheimer's Associationfound that 70% of caregivers reported that coordinating care is stressful. Socializing can also become more difficult after diagnosis.\n\"One thing I have heard again and again from people who come to our Memory Cafe is 'all of our friends disappeared,'\" saidBeth Soltzberg, a social worker atJewish Family and Children's service of Greater Boston, where she directs the Alzheimer's and related dementia family support program.\nThe inclusion of caregivers is what distinguishes memory cafes from other programs that serve people with cognitive impairment, like adult day care. Memory cafes don't offer formal therapies or support. At a memory cafe, having fun together and being socialisthe support. And that support is for the patient and their caregiver — because both can suffer from social isolation and distress after a diagnosis.\nA 2021 study fromFrontiers in Public Healthindicated that even online memory cafes during the pandemic provided social support for both patients and their family members.\n\"A Memory Cafe is a cafe which recognizes that some of the clients here may have cognitive impairment, some may not,\" saidJason Karlawish, a geriatrics professor at the University of Pennsylvania'sPerelman School of Medicineand the co-director of thePenn Memory Center.\nKarlawish regularly recommends memory cafes to his patients, in part because they benefit the caregivers as well.\n\"The caregiver-patient dyad, I find often, has achieved some degree of connection and enjoyment in doing things together,\" Karlawish said. \"For many, that's a very gratifying experience, because dementia does reshape relationships.\"\n\"That socialization really does help ease the stress that they feel from being a caregiver,\" saidKyra O'Brien, a neurologist who also teaches at Penn's Perelman School of Medicine. \"We know that patients have better quality of life when their caregivers are under less stress.\"\nGuests at the Gathering Place Memory meet up help eachother to read a trivia question.AIMEE DILGER/WVIA Newshide caption\nAs the populationgrows older, the number of available family caregivers is decreasing, according to theAARP's Public Policy Institute.The report found that the number of potential caregivers for an individual 80 or older will decrease significantly by 2050.\nIn 2024, the Alzheimer's Association issued areportprojecting a jump in dementia cases in the U.S. from an estimated 6.9 million people currently living with Alzheimer's dementia to 13.8 million people by 2060. It attributed this increase primarily to the aging of the baby boom generation, or those born between1946 and 1964.\nAs cases of memory loss are expected to rise, the Trump administration is attempting to cut billions in health spending. Since memory cafes don't rely on federal dollars, they may become an even more important part of the continuum of care for people with memory loss and their loved ones.\n\"We're fighting off some pretty significant Medicaid cuts at the Congressional level,\" saidGeorgia Goodman, director of Medicare policy forLeading Age, a national nonprofit network of aging services.\nAlthough Medicaid doesn't necessarily pay for memory cafes, they can play a part in long-term care, Goodman explained.\nActivities at the memory cafe include trivia, crafting, coloring and playing songs on the bells.AIMEE DILGER/WVIA Newshide caption\nThe nonprofitMemory Lane Care Servicesoperates two memory cafes in Toledo, Ohio. They're virtually free to operate, because they take place in venues that don't require payment, according toSalli Bollin, the executive director.\n\"That really helps from a cost standpoint, from a funding standpoint,\" Bollin said.\nOne of the memory cafes takes place once a month at a local coffee shop. The other meets at the Toledo Museum of Art. Memory Lane Care Services provides the museum employees with training in dementia sensitivity so they can lead tours for the memory cafe participants.\nThe memory cafe that Rob Kennedy attends in Northeast Pennsylvania costs about $150 a month to run, according to the host organization,The Gathering Place..\n\"This is a labor of love,\" said board memberPaula Baillie, referring to the volunteers who run the memory cafe. \"The fact that they're giving up time – they recognize that this is important.\" Baillie said.\nThe monthly budget goes to crafts, books, coffee, snacks and some utilities for the two-hour meetings. Local foundations provide grants that help her cover those costs.\nPaula Baille talks with guests at the Gathering Place in Clarks Summit during the Friday memory cafe, while Joe and Barb Edwards listen.AIMEE DILGER/WVIA Newshide caption\nEven though memory cafes are inexpensive and not dependent on federal funding, they could still face indirect obstacles as a result of the Trump administration's recent funding cuts.\nOrganizers worry that loss of federal funds could negatively impact the local institutions where they take place, such as libraries and other community spaces.\nAt least 39 states have hosted memory cafes recently, according toDementia Friendly America.Wisconsin has the most, with more than 100 memory cafes operating in the state.\nWisconsin has a strong infrastructure focused on memory care, which should keep the state's memory cafes running regardless of what is happening at the federal level, according toSusan McFadden, a professor emerita of psychology at theUniversity of Wisconsin, Oshkosh. She co-founded theFox Valley Memory Project, which oversees14 memory cafes.\n\"They've operated on the grassroots, they've operated on pretty small budgets and a lot of goodwill,\" she said.\nMany of those that attend just enjoy socializing and coloring.AIMEE DILGER/WVIA Newshide caption\nSince 2013, Wisconsin has also had a unique network for dementia care, with state-fundeddementia care specialistsfor each county and federally-recognized tribe in Wisconsin. The specialists help connect individuals with cognitive impairment to community resources, bolstering memory cafe attendance.\nMcFadden first heard about memory cafes in 2011, before they were popular in the United States. She was conducting research on memory and teaching courses on aging.\nMcFadden reached out to memory cafes in the United Kingdom, where the model was already popular and well-connected. Memory cafe organizers invited her to visit and observe them in person, so she planned a trip overseas with her husband.\nTheir tour skipped over the typical tourist hotspots, taking them to more humble settings.\n\"We saw church basements and senior center dining rooms and assisted living dining rooms,\" she said. \"That, to me, is really the core of memory cafes,\" McFadden added.\n\"It's hospitality. It's reaching out to people you don't know and welcoming them, and that's what they did for us.\"\nAfter her trip, McFadden started applying for grants and scouting locations that could host memory cafes in Wisconsin.\nShe opened her first one in Appleton, Wisconsin in 2012, just over a year after her transformative trip to the UK.\nThese days, she points interested people to a national directory of memory cafes hosted byDementia Friendly America. The organization'sMemory Cafe Alliancealso offers training modules — developed by McFadden and her colleague Anne Basting — to help people start establish the cafes in their own communities, wherever they are in the country.\n\"They're not so hard to set up, they're not expensive,\" McFadden said. \"It doesn't require an act of the legislature to do a memory cafe. It takes community engagement.\"\nThis story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership withWVIAandKFF Health News.",

        "content": "The CDC's vaccine schedule recommends COVID vaccines for children through 'shared clinical decision-making.' There is no recommendation for pregnant women.kamon_saejueng/iStockphoto/Getty Imageshide caption\nThe federal government has removed the recommendation that children and pregnant women get routine COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe change, reflected in new vaccine schedules posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on May 30,results from a directiveannounced on May 27 by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., ina minute-long video posted on X.\n\"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,\" Kennedy said in the video, \"We're now one step closer to realizing President Trump's promise to make America healthy again.\"\nThe reality of the recommendations is more nuanced.\nPreviously, the CDC had urged everyone six months and older to get annual, updated COVID shots as a routine recommendation.\nNow, the CDC's vaccine schedule recommends COVID vaccines for children throughshared clinical decision-making— that is, if a doctor and a patient decide together that it makes sense. And there'sno recommendationfor pregnant women to get COVID vaccines.\n\"We are relieved to see today that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its schedules for child and adolescent immunizations to allow families to maintain the choice to immunize their children against COVID in consultation with their doctor,\"Dr. Susan Kressly,President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in anemailed statement.\n\"However, the deeply flawed process to reach the recommendation raises serious concerns about the stability of the nation's immunization infrastructure and commitment by federal leaders to make sure families can access critical immunizations, whether for COVID or other infectious diseases,\" Kressly said.\nKennedy's announcement on May 27 blindsided CDC staff, who were not informed of the change to COVID-19 vaccine policy before the decision went public, according to a CDC official who requested anonymity since they were not authorized to speak to the media.\nHours afterthe post on X, CDC staffers received a directive from Secretary Kennedy — dated May 19, but sent May 27 — rescinding the department's 2022 acceptance of the CDC's recommendations for the use of COVID shots in children and during pregnancy. The directive, viewed by NPR, ordered the CDC to remove these recommendations from their vaccine schedules.\nThe changes contradict the advice of professional medical groups such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics, who continue to recommend COVID vaccines to children and pregnant women based on scientific evidence that shows they are safe and effective. Their logos appearedon previous versionsof the CDC's vaccine schedules, but are absent from the current versions as their recommendations no longer align.\nAlthough children don't tend to get seriously ill from COVID, some do,especially very young children. Pregnant womenremain at high riskfor serious complications from the virus, according to the American Academy of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\nPublic health experts are alarmed by how the changes were made. Typically, \"it's a very transparent public process,\" saysDr. Sean O'Leary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who represents the AAP as a liaison to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee. \"The data are shared publicly, the discussion happens publicly and then they come to a decision on how to recommend vaccines.\"\nThe closed-door process upends the public discussions and votes that have been a hallmark of vaccine policymaking for decades.\nThe decision will make it much harder for parents to get their children vaccinated and for pregnant people to get the shots, O'Leary says. For clinicians, \"shared clinical decision-making conversations are really challenging to have in a ten-minute office visit,\" he says, and with a loosening of the recommendations, fewer doctors' offices may choose to keep the vaccines on hand.\nSome insurance companies may no longer pay for them, saysRichard Hughes, a former executive at the vaccine company Moderna, who now teaches healthcare law and policy at George Washington University. \"Expect variability in coverage, prior authorization and out-of-pocket [costs], all of which will discourage uptake,\" he says.\nThe downgrading of COVID vaccine recommendations comes soon afterthe administration made changes that could dramatically restrictthe availability of the next round of COVID boosters. The government will now require additional testing for the vaccines to be approved for use by anyone other than people who are at high risk from COVID because they are age 65 or older or have risk factors for other health problems.",

        "content": "You're pregnant, healthy and hearing mixed messages: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,removed the COVID vaccinefrom the list of vaccinations you should get.\n\"I couldn't be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule\" Kennedy said on Tuesday.\nBut guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other researchers say being pregnant still puts you in ahigh-risk groupthat should receive boosters. The science is on the side of the shots.\nPregnant women who contracted COVID were more likely to become severely ill and to be hospitalized than women of the same age and demographics who weren't pregnant, especially early in the COVID pandemic.\nAnanalysisof 435 studies from around the world in 2019-2020 found that pregnant and recently pregnant women who were infected with COVID were more likely to end up in intensive care units, be on invasive ventilation, and die than women who weren't pregnant but had a similar health profile. This was before vaccines were available.\nDr.Neil Silverman,a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology, directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He said he still sees more bad outcomes in pregnant patients who have COVID. The risk of severe COVID fluctuated as new variants arose and vaccinations became available, Silverman said, but the threat is still meaningful.\n\"No matter what the politics say, the science is the science, and we know that objectively, pregnant patients are at substantially increased risk of having complications,\" Silverman said.\nA request for comment regarding the scientific literature that supports COVID vaccination for pregnant women sent to HHS's Public Affairs office elicited an unsigned email unrelated to the question. The office did not respond when asked for an on-the-record comment.\nThere's still a lot unknown about how COVID affects a pregnant person. The physiological relationship between COVID infections, mothers and fetuses at different stages of a pregnancy is complex, saidAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan.\nThe increased risk to pregnant patients comes in part because pregnancy changes the immune system, Rasmussen said.\n\"There is natural immune suppression so that the mother's body doesn't attack the developing fetus,\" Rasmussen said. \"While the mother does still have a functioning immune system, it's not functioning at full capacity,\" she added.\nPregnant patients are more likely to get sick and have a harder time fighting off any infection as a consequence.\nIn addition to changing how the immune system works, being pregnant also makes women five timesmore likelyto have blood clots. That risk is increased if they contract COVID saidSallie Permar, Chair of Pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine.\nThe virus that causes COVID can affect the vascular endothelium - specialized cells that line blood vessels and help with blood flow, Rasmussen said. In a healthy person, the endothelium helps prevent blood clots by producing chemicals that keep the vascular system running. In a person infected with COVID, the balance is thrown off and the production of those molecules is disrupted, whichresearch showscan lead to blood clots or other blood disorders.\nPermar said that those clots can be especially dangerous to both the pregnant women and baby. Inflammation and blood clotsin the placentacould be connected to an increased risk of stillbirth especially fromcertain COVID variants, according to studies published in major medical journals as well as by the CDC.\nWhen the placenta is inflamed, it's harder for blood carrying oxygen and nutrients to get to the baby, saidMary Prahl, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine.\n\"If anything is interrupting those functions – inflammation or clotting or differences in how the blood is flowing – that's really going to affect how the placenta is working and being able to allow the fetus to grow and develop appropriately,\" she said.\nIt makes sense that we see the effects of COVID in the placenta, Silverman said. \"The placenta is nothing more than a hyper-specialized collection of blood vessels, so it is like a magnetic target for the virus.\"\nBlood vessels in the placenta are smaller, thinner and clot more easily than in the mother's circulatory system, he said.\nPermar said more recent data suggests that pregnant women sick with COVID still have a higher risk of pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and miscarriage, even with existing immunity from previous infection or vaccination. Covid, she said, can still land women in the hospital with pregnancy complications.\nPrahl said the connection between stillbirth and COVID may be changing given the immunity many people have developedfrom vaccinationor prior infection. It's an area in which she'd like to see more research.\nThere's alreadystrong evidencethat both mRNA-based and non-mRNA COVID vaccines are safe for pregnant women.\nPrahl co-authored a small, earlystudythat found no adverse outcomes and showed antibody protection persisted for both the mother and the baby after birth. \"What we learned very quickly is that pregnant individuals want answers and many of them want to be involved in research,\" she said. Later studies, including one published in the journal Nature Medicine showing that getting a booster in pregnancycut newborn hospitalizationsin the first four months of life, backed up her team's early findings.\nPrahl expects more evidence will be available soon to support the benefits of mothers receiving a COVID booster during pregnancy.\n\"I can say kind of behind the scenes, I'm seeing a lot of this preliminary data,\" she said.\nShe blames the delay in part on the Biden administration's scaling back of federal efforts to track COVID.\"A lot of the surveillance of these data were pulled back,\" she said. The Trump administration isfurther cutting moneyused to track COVID.\nBut because the vaccine gives a pregnant woman's immune system a boost by increasing neutralizing antibodies, virologist Rasmussen is confident that getting one while pregnant makes it less likely a pregnant woman will end up in the hospital if she gets COVID.\n\"It will protect the pregnant person from more severe disease,\" she said.\nGetting a COVID vaccine while pregnant also helps protect newborns after birth. Pregnant women who get vaccinated pass that protection to their infants.\nAccording to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly90% of babieswho had to be hospitalized with COVID-19 hadmothers who didn't get the vaccinewhile they were pregnant. The study drew upon medical data in 12 states, collected between October 2022 and April 2024. Of the 1,470 infants sick enough to be hospitalized due to COVID, severe outcomes occurred \"frequently\" according to the report.\nExcluding newborns hospitalized at birth, about 1 in 5 infants hospitalized with COVID required intensive care, and nearly one in 20 required a ventilator.\nAnd babies too young to be vaccinated had the highest COVID hospitalization rate of any age group except people 75 and over.\nThe Trump administration's decision to remove the COVID vaccine from the list of shots it recommends for pregnant women means insurance companies may no longer cover it–so it may cost hundreds of dollars out of pocket.\n\"I don't want to be that doctor who just says, 'Well, it's really important. You have to vaccinate yourself and your kids no matter what, even if you have to pay for it out of pocket,' because everyone has their own priorities and budgetary concerns, especially in the current economic climate,\" Silverman said.\"I can't tell a family that the vaccine is more important than feeding their kids.\"\nBut he and his colleagues will keep advising pregnant women to try to get the shots if they can.\n\"Newborns will be completely naïve to COVID exposure,\" he said. \"Vaccinating pregnant women to protect their newborns is still a valid reason to continue this effort.\"\nKFF Health Newsis a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism",

Joe is receiving an experimental therapy to treat Alzheimer's.Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎hide caption\nJoe Walsh, 79, is waiting to inhale.\nHe's perched on a tan recliner at the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. His wife, Karen Walsh, hovers over him, ready to depress the plunger on a nasal spray applicator.\n\"One, two, three,\" a nurse counts. The plunger plunges, Walsh sniffs, and it's done.\nThe nasal spray contains an experimental monoclonal antibody meant to reduce the Alzheimer's-related inflammation in Walsh's brain.\nHe is the first person living with Alzheimer's to get the treatment, which is also being tested in people with diseases including multiple sclerosis, ALS and COVID-19.\nAnd the drug appears to be reducing the inflammation in Walsh's brain, researchers report in the journalClinical Nuclear Medicine.\n\"I think this is something special,\" says Dr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham who helped develop the nasal spray, along with its maker, Tiziana Life Sciences.\nWhether a decrease in inflammation will bring improvements in Walsh's thinking and memory, however, remains unclear.\nThe experimental treatment is part of a larger effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia.\nTwo drugs now on the market clear the brain of sticky amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic protein that accumulate between neurons. Other experimental drugs have targeted the tau tangles, a different protein that builds up inside nerve cells.\nBut fewer efforts have tried to address inflammation, a sign of Alzheimer's that becomes more pronounced as the disease progresses.\nDr. Brahyan Galindo-Mendez, right, administers an eye-tracking test to Walsh after his treatment.Jodi Hilton/‎for NPRhide caption\nOnce Joe Walsh has finished inhaling the experimental medication, he gets a cognitive exam from Dr. Brahyan Galindo-Mendez, a neurology fellow.\n\"Can you tell me your name please,\" Mendez asks. \"What's your name?\"\nAfter a pause, Walsh answers: \"Joe.\"\n\"And who is with you today?\" Mendez says, glancing toward Walsh's wife, Karen.\n\"We'll do that,\" Walsh replies.\n\"What's her name?\" Mendez persists.\n\"Her name,\" Walsh echoes. \"That's her name. That's my wife.\"\nWalsh is unable to put a name to the woman he's been married to for 36 years.\nIn 2019, a PET scan confirmed that Joe Walsh had Alzheimer's. It took Karen Walsh years to get her husband into a research study that would offer him an experimental treatment.Jodi Hilton/for NPRhide caption\nKaren Walsh began to notice a change in her husband back in 2017.\n\"He was struggling to find the right words to complete a thought or a sentence,\" she says.\nThe couple went to a primary care doctor, who said that if Walsh turned out to have Alzheimer's, he should enter a research study in hopes of getting one of the latest treatments. Then the doctor referred Walsh to a neurologist.\nIn 2019, a PET scan revealed extensive amyloid plaques in Walsh's brain, confirming the diagnosis.\n\"As much as I was in shock,\" Karen Walsh says, \"the words were ringing in my head: 'ask for the research.'\"\nSo she began looking for a clinical trial. But in 2020, COVID arrived in the U.S., shuttering hundreds of research studies. By the time the pandemic subsided, Walsh's Alzheimer's had progressed to the point where he no longer qualified for most studies.\nIn late 2024, Karen brought Joe to Dr. Seth Gale, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School who promised to look for a research study Walsh could enter.\nBefore long, Gale received a query from a colleague looking for a patient with moderate Alzheimer's disease to take part in a trial. He called the Walshes.\nThe research involved a monoclonal antibody called foralumab that was being tested on people with inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis.\nForalumab nasal spray, above, is being tested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at Mass General Brigham.Jodi Hilton/for NPRhide caption\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering around nerve fibers, causing inflammation. And foralumab was producing promising results in MS patients.\n\"It induces regulatory cells that go to the brain and shut down inflammation,\" Weiner says.\nThose regulatory cells reduce the activity of microglia, the cells that serve as the primary immune system in the brain and spinal cord.\nWeiner thought foralumab might help with another condition that causes damaging inflammation in the nervous system.\n\"I've always been interested in Alzheimer's disease,\" Weiner says. \"I lost my mother to Alzheimer's disease.\"\nMost efforts to treat Alzheimer's involve clearing the brain of the disease's hallmarks: sticky amyloid plaques and tangled fibers called tau. But increasingly, researchers are seeking ways to tamp down the inflammation that accompanies those brain changes, especially as the disease progresses.\n\"Once people have Alzheimer's, the inflammation is driving the disease more,\" Weiner says.\nDr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎hide caption\nThe approach worked in mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's.\nBut in order to treat Walsh, Weiner's team had to get special permission from the Food and Drug Administration through a program called expanded access. The program is for patients who can't get into a clinical trial and have no other treatment options.\nWhen the FDA approved foralumab for Walsh, he became the first Alzheimer's patient to get the treatment.\nSix months later, the drug has dramatically reduced the inflammation in Walsh's brain. But no drug can restore brain cells that have already been lost.\nIt will take a battery of cognitive tests to see if Walsh's memory and thinking have improved with the treatment. Karen Walsh, though, sees some positive signs.\nAlthough her husband still struggles to find words, she says, he appears to be more engaged in social activities.\n\"A couple of guys come pick him up once a month, you know, and they take him out for lunch,\" she says. \"They sent me a text after saying, 'Wow, Joe is really, really laughing, and very involved.'\"\nAfter three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎hide caption\nWalsh himself seems happy to stay on the drug. Between non sequiturs, he manages to put together a complete sentence: \"It's easy enough to take it, so I do it, and it feels good.\"\nA clinical trial of foralumab for Alzheimer's disease is scheduled to begin later this year.",

        "content": "This snake statue is one of eight that loomed in a Geneva Park during May's World Health Assembly — drawing attention to the new initiative to fight snakebite. The colors used are those of the Nigerian flag.Owen Davies/Getty Imageshide caption\nVenomous snakebite is \"the biggest public health crisis you've never heard of,\" said former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan as he was working to get the issue onto the global health agenda in 2015.\nEach year, roughly 140,000 people die from snakebite 'envenoming' (basically, when a venomous snake delivers venom into the body through a bite or spray). Another 2 to 3 million are bitten each year and survive but can face serious injury or long-term disability as a result.\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization recognized snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease. \"Since then, only limited progress has been made,\" saidDavid Lalloo, vice chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\nThat's where the snake statues come in.\nAs part of an effort to put the dangers of snakebite back on the agenda, Lalloo and a group of global health experts launched Strike Out Snakebite at the World Health Forum that wrapped up this week in Geneva. To garner attention, the initiative erected eight large snake statues around the city.\nNPR spoke with Lalloo, who has worked on snakebite for about 30 years, about the statues, the hidden burden of snakebites and what the initiative aims to achieve.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nSo I've got to start with the snake statues. What's the deal there?\nThey were pretty spectacularly colored and colorful and pretty large. I actually saw them before I knew they were part of the initiative. I thought, this is really weird. There was no label at that point, so you just saw this snake in the middle of the park.\n\"Silent Fang\" is the name of this snake sculpture displayed in Geneva — a term used to draw attention to the dangers of snakebite. The artist notes that the snake is decorated with the colors of the Pakistani flag — dark green and white.Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europehide caption\nBut they certainly attracted lots of attention throughout the week. People generally are fascinated by snakes, they either love them or hate them but are fascinated. So these are a very effective way of capturing their attention, to get the general public behind this as an issue.\nI think a lot of people don't think of snakebite as a major global health problem. Why does it deserve more attention?\nSnakebite is a problem that's very much hidden to the broader populations living in cities and to health planners because it does affect the poorest of the communities in the poorest areas of relatively poor countries. The challenge is that almost all of those individuals live in rural areas, often going about their daily work in the fields.\nBecause it occurs in such remote areas, we don't have very good statistics. And so it's very much under-recognized as a big problem.\nWhat can happen when someone gets bitten by a venomous snake?\nThere's a wide variety of effects.\nSome venomous snakes will cause a lot of local swelling, occasionally you can get quite significant tissue damage. If you get tissue breakdown, you may get ulcers, you may lose the skin. Those will not always heal well, particularly if you haven't got very good surgical facilities, so people can lose function of an arm or a leg because of snakebite. That can have a huge impact on their life, and their family's life, if they're the breadwinner.\nA statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europehide caption\nAnd then you can have severe neurotoxicity [damage to the nervous system] that stops breathing or causes blood clotting problems. People will die from severe neurotoxicity and sometimes from bleeding or shock.\nThere's some really interesting evidence on psychological morbidity as well, that people after snakebite have depression or post-traumatic stress disorders.\nWhat was the goal of the Strike Out Snakebite initiative at the World Health Assembly this week?\nThe ultimate goal is that every adult and child that needs an antivenom gets a high quality antivenom delivered to them rapidly. The steps on the way to that are to, first of all, have a choice of different antivenoms we know are both effective and safe, and to have supply chain systems that will get those to the patients that need them.\nAlongside that, you'll have a workforce that is well-trained, that is familiar with how you manage snakebite. And then I think we'll have clear education campaigns for the population about how they avoid snakebite and what they do if they get snakebite.\nIn 2019, WHO developed a roadmap for snakebite envenoming. It was estimated that about $140 million would be necessary to achieve that. In reality, only between 10% to 15% of that funding has been achieved. This initiative is very much an attempt to ultimately just put snakebite back on the map and highlight where we need investment to make a big difference to this disease.\nWhat's the current state of treatment?\nAntivenoms are the mainstay of treatment, and they're made by putting snake venom into an animal, usually a horse or sheep. Then you take the blood from the animal, you process that and make it into an antivenom.\nBut the venom of different species is very, very different indeed. The venom of Asian snakes is completely different to that of African snakes. And even across the African continent, the venom of different species will vary quite considerably. So that has to be taken into account when you're making antivenoms and when you're distributing antivenoms.\nOne of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europehide caption\nAnother challenge with antivenoms, particularly in Africa, is that they have not always been very well regulated. So there've been poor quality or ineffective antivenoms around. So the number of people, particularly in Africa, that have access to effective, high quality antivenoms is very low indeed. Even when there are good antivenoms available, they tend to be very expensive and way beyond the affordability for many health systems.\nAre there efforts to develop newer vaccines?\nThere's a lot of work trying to specifically target antibody molecules against the toxins, rather than being pretty crude and sticking venom into a horse.\nThere are also efforts to develop drugs that will neutralize some of these toxins. The advantage of a drug is that they could potentially be given by mouth in very remote settings, whereas antivenom needs to be given into the vein. And you can only do that in bigger health clinics or hospitals. And so a drug that you could give in a very remote area would potentially be life-saving. Because most people are bitten in rural areas, it takes a long time to reach full health facilities.\nWhat about delivering care, what can be improved there?\nI think there's some very simple stuff that could be done on training of both medical personnel and the population.\nThere's also this element of educating populations about prevention — how do you prevent snakes biting you? When is the most dangerous time for snakes to bite? Are there things you can do to protect, seal your hut or your house to stop snakes [from] coming inside?\nThere's also a need to educate the population so that they know that if they have a severe snakebite, they need to go to the nearest health facility as soon as possible. Antivenom is more effective if it's given as soon after the bite as possible.\nI think the health system challenges are going to be considerable in terms of getting antivenoms to the right place, with appropriately trained staff at smaller centers closer to rural areas. The reality is that countries find the antivenom bills quite substantial.\nAll these efforts will cost money. Are you concerned about funding this lesser-known problem in the current climate of shrinking funds for global health?\nWell, the short answer is yes. It's probably the most difficult time for global health funding in the last 20 years. We need to look for different sources of funding and also need to look at how we can integrate this [snakebite initiative] with the other initiatives, like efforts to have community health workers deliver more primary care.\nWith a little bit of initiative and a bit of funding, we can make a big difference.\nPostscript: The snake sculptures were taken down after the World Health Assembly ended this week. They're currently on their way to London, where they'll stay until they can find a permanent home.",

        "content": "Earlier this year, as President Donald Trump was beginning to reshape the American government, Michael, an emergency room doctor who was born, raised, and trained in the United States, packed up his family and left the country.\nMichael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.\n\"Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,\" Michael said. \"And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.\"\nMichael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.\nThe Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts onphysiciansapply.ca, which is \"typically the first step\" to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada's most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.\n\"The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they're Americans,\" said John Philpott, CEO ofCanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. \"They state that right out of the gate: 'I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.'\"\nCanada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American healthcare system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.\nThe Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors' leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their \"citizenship status,\" then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.\nPhilpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.\nPhilpott said CanAm has seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs between January and April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.\nRohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.\n\"They're ready to move to Canada tomorrow,\" she said. \"They are not concerned about what their income is.\"\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada's most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.\nBritish Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.\nQuebec's College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada \"specifically because of the actual presidential administration.\"\nMichael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he describes as escalating right-wing political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.\nMichael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.\n\"Civil discourse was falling apart,\" he said. \"I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.\"\nIt then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was \"not difficult,\" he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.\n\"The process wasn't any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,\" Michael said. \"The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don't want to go through that process again.\"\nMichael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.\nThis desire to leave has also been striking toHippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.\nThe company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was \"terrified that Trump would win again.\" For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.\nBut after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.\n\"Previously it had been about adventure,\" Bapat said. \"But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.\"\nAt least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.\nDoctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada's worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.\nThe campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises \"zero political interferencein physician patient relationship\" as a selling point.\nAlison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America's for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.\nCarleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.\nShe dropped her American citizenship last year.\n\"People I know have said, 'You left just in time,'\" Carleton said. \"I tell people, 'I know. When are you going to move?'\"\nKFF Health Newsis a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

        "content": "Federal agencies identified listeria contamination in some Boar's Head deli meats last year.  Since Trump's cuts to federal agencies, experts worry inspectors can't keep up with demand.Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty Imageshide caption\nPaula Soldner inspected meat and poultry plants around southern Wisconsin for 38 years: \"I'm talking brats, hot dogs, summer sausage, pizza.\"\nHer Department of Agriculture job requireddaily check-ups on factories to ensure slicers were cleaned on schedule, for example. Her signoff allowed plants to put red-white-and-blue \"USDA inspected\" stickers on grocery-store packages.\nLast month, Soldner took the Trump administration up on its offer of early retirement, joining an exodus from the Food Safety and Inspection Service that began under President Biden's reorganization of the agency last year. Soldner, who alsochairsthe National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, says remaining inspectors must now visit eight facilities — double the usual number — each day.\nThat's not possible, she says, so it's unclear how much food is legitimately earning that stamp of approval.\n\"Did that plant receive that daily inspection from inspection personnel? In my mind, that's a huge question mark,\" Soldner says.\nShe says further staff retirements, hostility toward federal workers, and plummeting morale are creating conditions that make consumersmore vulnerable to outbreaks of foodborne illness, like thedeadly listeria contaminationthat hit Boar's Head deli meats last year, killing 10 people and hospitalizing dozens.\n\"Do I foresee another Boar's Head situation? Absolutely,\" she says. \"I worry about the public.\"\nExperts who study the nation's food supply say the safety of everything we eat — from milk and macaroni to meat and lettuce — is called into question because ofmassive cutsby the Trump administration to the three federal agencies charged with monitoring it: the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThose three agencies coordinate and fund a lot of the complex work that makes up the country's food safety surveillance system, while state and local regulators and inspectors conduct a lot of work on the ground.\nMost produce is inspected by states, for example, though select samples are sent to one of the FDA's national labs to test for pathogens like salmonella orE.coli.When a consumer falls ill, it's often the local health officials who are first to know and then report cases to the CDC, which in turn traces the contamination to its sources and compiles data.\n\"Our federal food safety system is teetering on the brink of a collapse,\" says Sarah Sorscher, a policy expert at theCenter for Science in the Public Interest.She's most concerned about the loss of expertise from recent job cuts.\nBut she also worries about policy moves like the administration's rollback of new USDA food-safety rules set last August that would have limited the amount of salmonella in poultry in order for it to be sold. Instead, the agency said it isreevaluating the issueand whether salmonella regulations need updating at all.\nIn statements emailed to NPR, FDA and USDA said recent streamlining of their operations will not alter their commitment to food safety. USDAannounced Tuesdaythat it boosted funds to reimburse states for food safety inspections by $14.5 million.\nIn a separate emailed statement, the USDA called its inspectors' work \"critical,\" and said therefore inspectors wereexempt from its hiring freeze, and its \"front-line inspectors and veterinarians were not offered the opportunity to participate\" in the agency's second early retirement offer in April \"because of the essential nature of their work.\"\nHowever, NPR reviewed emails sent from USDA officials urging inspectors to take the early retirementdeal and confirming their eligibility for it, as well as a document listing eligible job categories, including consumer safety inspector and slaughterhousesinspectors.\nLast month, the Trump administration also abruptly shuttered two of the FDA's seven food testing labs in San Francisco and Chicago, according to several FDA staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\nThe ensuing chaos delayed seafood inspections and routine produce testing, the FDA staffers, including microbiologists working in different labs, told NPR. Samples of lettuce or fruit had to be shipped in ice-packed containers to redirect them to other labs, where a shortage of staff and basic lab supplies such asplastic pipettes and other testing supplies, makes it difficult to triage the workload.\nThis month, the administration reopened the two labs, but Sorscher, who leads regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says damage has been done. \"It's as if you took a chainsaw and started cutting holes out of the walls of a house,\" she says. \"You can't really point to the fact that the doors or windows are still there and say, 'Don't worry, the house is secure.'\"\nThe CDC said in an emailed statement that its lab, surveillance and data collection work continues and that the agency \"remains prepared to respond to, and work with states on those outbreaks.\"\nBut many of the state and local food-safety programs historically funded by the CDC are at risk, saysSteven Mandernach, executive director of theAssociation of Food and Drug Officials. Budgets and staffing have been cut at CDC, which affects how it supports local programs. The CDC, for example, typically funded staff to notify the public in the event of outbreaks, or to help remove dangerous products from shelves, as they did withlead-contaminated apple sauce pouches in 2023.\nMandernach says many states can no longer afford staff dedicated to public communications. So he worries about delayed warnings and less robust local tracking of cases that would affect national data.\n\"It could artificially make it look like, 'Hey, food safety is great here,' when the reality is we're not looking for it as much,\" he says.",

        "content": "The drug use survey team worked for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which saw massive staff cuts in the Trump administration overhaul.Cappi Thompson/Moment RF/Getty Imageshide caption\nA federal study on mental health problems and substance use across the country that has been running for decades and is used by a wide range of researchers faces an uncertain future after President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce.\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Healthis an annual survey of households conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, which is being dissolved in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s overhaul of the nation's health agencies.\n\"We survey about 70,000 people, 12 and older each year,\" says Jennifer Hoenig, who used to lead the team of scientists in charge of the survey, which is the largest in the country\nOn April 1, Hoenig and her 16-person team of mostly statisticians lost their jobs to the layoffs orchestrated by Elon Musk's DOGE effort to shrink the federal government. The Department of Health and Human Services fired 10,000 staff, while another 10,000 employees took buyouts and early retirement offers.\nIn a statement to NPR, Emily Hilliard, press secretary at HHS, wrote that agency staff are working with a contractor to continue conducting the 2025 survey. And the 2024 annual report will be out later this summer. Since the firings, the agency has published two brief reports based on the 2023 survey – one onuse of marijuanaby people 12 years and older and one about thetreatments received by adults with serious mental illness.\nHoenig and her colleagues analyzed the survey data each year and put out detailed reports on the prevalence of mental health problems and substance use.\n\"It is really the first line for people to understand the prevalence of substance use, substance use disorders and mental health outcomes, treatment, recovery and things like that,\" Hoenig says.\nIn addition to a report on national estimates, Hoenig says her team also put out \"state and substate\" estimates. \"It allows people to really figure out 'who are the people in the country that need help, who are these people? Where do they live? What are their issues?'\"\n\"Those of us who work in the field and also a lot of states, they know it's one of the major tools for assessing behavioral health in America,\" saysSean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan.\nIna recent studypublished in JAMA Pediatrics, McCabe and his colleagues used the data from the survey and estimated that 1 in 4 kids in the United States has a parent with a substance use disorder.\nHe says this data is critical for researchers like himself as well as lawmakers and health care care providers. \"Addressing addiction and promoting recovery are national priorities, and it's really difficult to monitor progress without one of America's gold standard metrics.\"\nThe same goes for efforts to address mental health problems, saysKatherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who has also used the NSDUH data for years for her research.\n\"Unless we know how many people are affected by common mental health problems, it will really hamper our efforts to determine whether the interventions that we're trying to implement are having any kind of effect,\" says Keyes.\n\"This is really a central piece of data,\" saysDr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"When we use it clinically, it's often in a way that is helping pediatricians like me and my colleagues across the country understand what's going on with teenagers.\"\nFor example, the prevalence of opioid addiction among teens.\n\"We know now from the NSDUH that about one in 80 teenagers struggles with opioid addiction,\" says Hadland. \"That's a lot higher than any pediatrician would guess. And we only know that because of this survey.\"\nThe data also reflects the success of past efforts to address substance use among young people, says Keyes. \"You look at factors like cigarette and tobacco use among young people, which is at extraordinary lows. Binge drinking and alcohol use has been declining among young people.\"\nBut there's still a long way to go, she adds. And \"if some of these trends reverse, we need to know immediately.\"\nHilliard says the survey will continue as HHS reorganizes, and Kennedyhas indicatedthat mental health and substance use issues will be managed by a new agency he plans to form called the Administration for a Healthy America.\nBut Hoenig says it's unclear how the survey will continue without her team of scientists. Hadland stresses that it's important to have scientists at the helm of the survey.\n\"This idea that there's sort of a group of experts overseeing the entire survey and really looking out for its future and the reliability and the validity of the questions in the survey is really critical,\" he says.\nAnd it's important that the data gathered by the survey is made available to the public, says Hoenig.\n\"If that information is not being disseminated out into the public, we will lose lives,\" she says. \"We will lose lives to overdose. We will lives to suicide. But these are entirely preventable.\"",

The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public,\" Nixon said.\nHe added that \"the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.\" The official did not provide any additional details.\nJennifer Nuzzo, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was \"disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous.\"\n\"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply,\" Nuzzo added in an email. \"What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket.\"\nThe cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced \"positive interim\" results and the company \"had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development.\"\n\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program,\" Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, saidin a statement. \"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats.\"\nThe administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.\n\"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk,\" said Dr.Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.\n\"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection,\" Jha said. \"The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd.\"\nMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agreed.\n\"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic,\" he said in an email. \"This is a dangerous course to follow.\"\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 1,072 dairy herds, more than 173 million poultry, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.",

        "content": "The CDC team responsible for aggregating and disseminating best practices around contraception has been cut.Liudmila Chernetska/iStockphoto/Getty Imageshide caption\nTo most people, the eight-person team was indistinguishable from the hundreds of other scientists and researchers cut in April during the mass firings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBut for many clinicians who specialize in women's health, losing the team responsible for the CDC's contraception guidelines was a devastatingblow to women's health.\n\" I just remember feeling like — of all the things — I think contraception shouldn't be controversial,\" says Dr. Angeline Ti, a family physician in the Atlanta, Georgia area who specializes in reproductive healthcare.\nThe team was responsible for aggregating and disseminating best practices around contraception in a set of guidelines calledU.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use.\n\"I knew that things were gonna happen at CDC, but I thought that these guidelines were so important,\" says Ti. She says she uses the guidelines \"pretty much every time\" she sees a patient for contraceptive care.\nOther doctors describe feeling equally shocked. \"I mean, there is no other resource that is doing this,\" says Dr. Andrea Braden, an obstetrician in Atlanta, Georgia. \"All the OB-GYN's use it.\"\nRepresentatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Trump administration did not explain why the CDC team was cut. It was eliminated in April as part of the reduction of the Women's Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.\nNPR reached out to HHS for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.\nAn indispensable app\nBusy doctors who are seeing many patients, says Braden, simply do not have time to comb through all the latest medical research. So, the CDC team made recommendations availablein an appthat doctors could download and easily reference with questions about contraception, including how to navigate the topic for patients with specific conditions and diseases. It was downloaded440,000 times, according to the CDC.\n\"The app was just a game changer for us,\" says Braden. \"That was very clearly organized, really easy to digest, and it was such a nice quick reference for us. It was a resource that we all trusted intuitively.\"\nThe current guidelines are still accessible, while the team charged with updating them no longer exists.\nDoctors caution that even though the recommendations were issued relatively recently, without careful monitoring they will soon be out of date. \" Medicine is not static,\" says Dr. Deva Sharma, a hematologist who said the guidelines are a critical part of her medical practice. \"It's constantly evolving and improving.\"\nThe team issued guidelines most recently in 2024. One example of a change that Braden says had a significant impact on her conversations with her patients is around recommendations for breastfeeding mothers using birth control. The new guidelines for the first time acknowledged that some contraception can jeopardize milk supply in nursing mothers.\nThis update, she says, represented a sea change in a way of thinking about the importance of empowering patients to make their own decisions about breastfeeding. \" That was such an important aspect of the update,\" says Braden. \"It helped us guide our practice, rather than tell people what they need after they have a baby. It really put the patient at the center of the conversation.\"\nFor some patients and doctors dealing with specific conditions, conversations about contraception can be matters of life or death. Sharma specializes in treating women with Sickle Cell disease — an inherited red blood cell disorder — which puts patients at amuch greater riskof life threatening complications in pregnancy than people without the disease.\nSharma calls the termination of the CDC team \"detrimental to women's health,\" and also recalls vividly the moment she found out when a colleague sent her a message. \"I remember just feeling overwhelmed and devastated,\" says Sharma.\nIn the recent guidelines, the CDC team changed recommendations for women with Sickle Cell Disease, which already puts patients at increased risk for blood clots. Doctors who treat this disease say they now rarely prescribe certain forms of contraception to their patients due to new evidence suggesting these kinds of treatments can create an even greater risk.\nBraden says she is still feeling confused as to why such a valuable resource was eliminated. \" I don't understand,\" she says \"Why them? Why this sector of medicine? This is a waste.\"\nShe warns that doctors will not be able to compensate for the medical updates that this guide provides. \" Medicine changes so quickly and it is very difficult to keep up with all of it,\" she warns. \"New data comes out — new research comes out — and we find out that there's a better way to do things. Contraceptive medicine is no different from that.\"\nMissing treatment options are hard to measure\nMany patients will not necessarily know about medical updates they do not benefit from, but Teonna Woolford is one patient who does understand the utility of the CDC's guidelines around contraception.\nBorn withSickle Cell Disease,Woolford started a non-profit,Sickle Cell Reproductive Education Directive, that advocates for patients like herself. Woolford says the disease is often characterized by uncertainty and difficulty in making hard decisions around treatment.\n\"Having the guidelines was really like a proactive approach to addressing contraception,\" says Woolford. \"There are a lot of knowledge and research gaps on this subject.\"\nSickle Cell Disease disproportionately affects people of color, a group that Woolford notes has not historically enjoyed parity in reproductive justice. \"The removal of the CDC team to me justreminds me of darker timesin our history when people of color were oppressed,\" she says.\nBlack women in the United States have disproportionatelyhigh rates of maternal mortality.\nDr. Braden sees the team's elimination as a setback to women everywhere. \"It really hurts those of us in women's health — to target something like contraceptives.\" says Braden. \"This is basic healthcare for OBGYNs and it was really defeating. I would say I felt angry and sad and confused.\"\nShe and other doctors point out that many women in the U.S. can no longer legally terminate pregnancy. They say that makes it especially important for them to be able to make an informed choice about the best ways to prevent becoming pregnant in the first place.\n\" Bodily autonomy has been taken away from women in various states,\" says Dr. Sharma, who practices in Tennessee — a statewith strict abortion laws.\"We've slashed people's rights to make decisions,\" she says. \"Now we're taking away evidence-based recommendations.\"",

Their home sits in the town of Bama in the northeastern corner of Nigeria that has, in the past, been terrorized by Boko Haram, the militant Islamist group.\nBabagana had sickle cell disease and, in the middle of the night on Feb. 2, Mohammed noticed her son had a fever. As soon as morning came, she rushed him in a keke — a tricycle taxi common in Nigeria — to the local clinic a little over a mile away where Babagana had received care in the past.\nWhen she got there, the security guard told her the clinic was closed.\nThe clinic was funded by USAID, or the U.S. Agency for International Development, and was the busiest medical facility in the area, seeing up to 400 patients a day. But, just over a week before Babagana arrived, the Trump administration sent the clinic a stop-work order — part of a massive pause in foreign assistance as U.S. officials reviewed contracts and programs to determine whether they should continue.\nMore than 80% of foreign aid contracts were canceledbut Babagana's clinic was allowed to resume operations on April 14, after the review was complete and the funding restarted.\nBut that was more than two months after Mohammed's visit on that February morning. She remembers standing outside the closed clinic with Babagana. \"I was shocked and became angry,\" she told NPR by phone on May 23. She spoke in Kanuri, a local language in Nigeria. \"Immediately, I prayed for God to intervene.\"\nThat night, Babagana died.\nMohammed says Babagana's care at the U.S.-funded clinic had been free and she didn't have money to take him to the local government clinic, which charges for medical care.\nBabagana's doctor at the clinic — Edifre Jacob — says he'll never know exactly what happened to the youngster because he did not get medical help before dying, but Jacob feels confident his team could have prevented his death.\n\"We are sure we would have done something to save the patient,\" says Jacob. \"We have the facility to manage these patients, and we have results — positive results — from patients we manage with sickle cell [disease].\"\nSickle cell disease is a condition where a person's red blood cells are deformed, causing them to break down more quickly than normal and potentially clog blood vessels. The condition is associated with a long list of dangerous complications, but prompt medical care can make a big difference.\nEven in places with far more medical resources, quick medical care for sickle cell patients is critical. \"We recommend that if a child has a fever, that they be seen as soon as possible, and often within the hour,\" says Dr.Natasha Archer, director of the sickle cell disease program at Boston Children's Hospital.\nShe says there are several serious conditions Babagana could have had. One is sepsis — a life-threatening infection that can cause a fever. People with sickle cell disease are vulnerable because their spleens often don't clean blood as well as in a healthy person. With quick access to antibiotics, sepsis can be curable, Archer says.\nNPR asked the State Department to comment on Babagana's death and Rubio's congressional testimony. They did not respond in time to meet our deadline for publication. We will update this article with their comment if they do respond.\nAt the hearings where Rubio spoke, lawmakers highlighted other individual stories of deaths that they attributed to aid cuts. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said thatPe Kha Lauin Myanmar was unable to get oxygen at a local hospital after the aid cuts and thatEvan Anzoo, a 5-year-old in South Sudan, could not get HIV medications previously funded by USAID.\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., went a step further, citing work from a team at Boston University that aims to estimate the total human cost of cuts to aid through modeling. Such estimates represent a crucial tool in understanding the possible implications of policy actions.\n\"Monitoring mortality in low- and middle-income countries is difficult, the systems are not as robust as we have in the United States,\" saysBrooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler who led the team. Many of the health systems that might have collected such data were funded by the same programs that got cut, she says.\nNichols and her team started working within days of the Trump administration's freeze of USAID to project the potential impact on human lives. They started with the assumption that all USAID programs were cut, based on publicly available data at the time. Then they factored in what researchers know about what happens when people and children with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases stop getting treatment.\nAll told, the researchers estimate thatover 96,000 adults and 200,000 infants and childrenhave already died because of cuts, which began on Jan. 24.\n\"It's really important they're doing this,\" says Dr.Chris Beyrer, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. \"Generally speaking, their assumptions are quite reasonable.\"\nStill, Nichols is the first to acknowledge that these are very rough estimates.\n\"The error bars are huge, because we don't know what gaps are being filled and by whom,\" says Nichols. National governments could be stepping in to make up for the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. aid, or nongovernmental organizations on the ground could be finding other sources of funding. Or some clinics could still be operating with volunteers or with funding from other sources.\nTheir estimates are not accounting for some deaths, such as Babagana's, who likely died from causes they didn't include in their analyses. Even with all that uncertainty, Nichols stands by her estimates. \"We can argue about the specifics and the size of the error bars, but we're not talking about dozens of people [dying],\" she says. \"We're talking about tens of thousands of people.\"\nRubio is dismissive of their modeling. \"That's false, that's fake,\" the secretary of state said of the numbers cited by Merkley at the hearing. He pointed to the fact that these estimates are based on a total cessation of funding, whereas he said 85% of people who rely on PEPFAR — the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS that funds HIV clinics — were still receiving care.\nRubio did not provide further information on the source of the 85% number. The State Department did not respond to multiple requests for clarification.\nIt \"seems impossible to me\" that 85% of recipients are still getting care, saysJohn Stover, vice president of Avenir Health, a global health consulting firm. \"USAID was dismantled, and most of that [PEPFAR] money was flowing through USAID, so there's no mechanism for that money to reach the programs that need it,\" he said, and far fewer people to implement those programs.\nNichols said she would happily update the model of estimated deaths with more information about what programs are still operational. \"If there are programs that are running, provide a list, then we can update it.\"\nMariam Mohammed and her surviving son, Umar. Like his brother who died, Umar has sickle cell disease, and she worries about his health.Edifre Jacobhide caption\nMariam Mohammed says she now lives in fear of losing her older son — 9-year-old Umar — who also has sickle cell disease. She says she's relieved that the clinic hospital has reopened, but the previous stop-work order underscores for her the fragility of the system.\nShe says her one wish is that USAID programs are allowed to continue.\nUmar says simply that he misses playing with his little brother.",

Mining is still part of the local economy, but many area residents have low-wage jobs that make them eligible for Medicaid.Linda Gross for KFF Health Newshide caption\nGLOBE, Ariz. — Like many residents of this copper-mining town in the mountains east of Phoenix, Debbie Cox knows plenty of people on Medicaid.\nCox, who is a property manager at a real estate company in Globe, has tenants who rely on the safety-net program. And at the domestic violence shelter where she volunteers as president of the board, Cox said, staff always look to enroll women and their children if possible.\nBut Cox, who is 65, has mixed feelings about Medicaid.\n\"It's not that I don't see the need for it. I see the need for it literally on a weekly basis,\" she said. \"I also see a need for revamping it significantly because it's been taken advantage of for so long.\"\nIt wasn't hard to find people in Globe like Cox with complicated views about Medicaid.\nDebbie Cox, a property manager, says she has tenants who need Medicaid to get medical care, but she also thinks the program needs to be strengthened to prevent abuses.Linda Gross for KFF Health Newshide caption\nGila County, where Globe is located, is a conservative place — almost 70% of voters went for President Trump in November. And concerns about government waste run deep.\nLike many rural communities, it's also a place where people have come to value government health insurance. The number of Gila County residents on Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program has nearly doubled over the past 15 years, according to data from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. Today, almost 4 in 10 residents are on one of the health insuranceplans for low- and moderate-income people or those with disabilities.\nSo,since House Republicans passed plans tocut roughly $716 billionfrom Medicaid, the nationaldebate taking placeover the program hits close to home for many Globe residents, even as some welcome the prospect of tighter rules and less government spending.\nFor Heather Heisler, the stakes are high. Her husband has been on Medicaid for years.\n\"We're ranchers, and there's not much money in ranching,\" said Heisler, who gets her own health care from the Indian Health Service. \"Most people think there is, but there isn't.\"\nHeisler was selling handicrafts outside the old county jail in Globe on a recent Friday night when the town hosted a downtown street fair with food trucks and live music.\nShe said Medicaid was especially helpful after her husband had an accident on the ranch. A forklift tipped over, and he had to have part of his left foot amputated.\n\"If anything happens, he's able to go to the doctor,\" she said. \"Go to the emergency room, get medicines.\"\nShe shook her head when asked what would happen if he lost the coverage. \"It would be very bad for him,\" she said.\nAmong other things, the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" passed by House Republicans would require working-age Medicaid enrollees to prove they are employed or seeking work. The bill, which has advanced to the Senate, would also mandate more paperwork from people to prove they're eligible.\nDifficult applications can dissuade many people from enrolling in Medicaid, even if they're eligible,researchers have found. And the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Office estimatesmore than 10 million people will likely lose Medicaid and CHIP insurance under the House Republican plan.\nThat would reverse big gains made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act that has allowed millions of low-income, working-age adults in places like Globe to get health insurance.\nNationally, Medicaid and CHIP have expanded dramatically over the past two decades, with enrollment in the programs surging from about56 millionin 2005 to more than78 millionlast year, according to federal data.\n\"Medicaid has always played an important role,\" said Joan Alker, who runs the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. \"But its role has only grown over the last couple of decades. It really stepped in to address many of the shortcomings in our health care system.\"\nThat's particularly true in rural areas, where the share ofpeople with disabilitiesis higher, residents have lower incomes, and communities are reliant on industries with skimpier health benefits such as agriculture and retail.\nIn Globe, former Mayor Fernando Shipley said he's seen this firsthand.\n\"A lot of people think, 'Oh, those are the people that aren't working.' Not necessarily,\" said Shipley, who operates a State Farm office across the road from the rusted remains of the Old Dominion copper mine. \"If you're a single parent with two kids and you're making $20 an hour,\" he added, \"you're not making ends meet. You've got to pay rent; you've got to feed those kids.\"\nFernando Shipley is the former mayor of Globe, Ariz. He says many of the people who rely on Medicaid are working, and otherwise wouldn't be able to afford health care for their families.Linda Gross for KFF Health Newshide caption\nNot far away, at the local hospital, some low-wage workers at the registration desk and in housekeeping get health care through Medicaid, chief financial officer Harold Dupper said. \"As much as you'd like to pay everyone $75,000- or $80,000-a-year, the hospital couldn't stay in business if that was the payroll,\" he said, noting the financial challenges faced by rural hospitals.\nThe growing importance of Medicaid in places like Globe helps explain why Republican efforts to cut the program face so much resistance, even among conservatives.\n\"There's been a shift in the public's attitude, and particularly voters on the right, that sometimes government plays a role in getting people health care. And that's OK,\" said pollster Bob Ward. \"And if you take away that health care, people are going to be angry.\"\nWard's Washington, D.C., firm, Fabrizio Ward, polls for Trump, among other clients. He also works for a coalition trying to protect Medicaid.\nAt the same time, many of the communities where Medicaid has become more vital in recent years remain very conservative politically.\nMore than two-thirds of nearly 300 U.S. counties with the biggest growth in Medicaid and CHIP since 2008 backed Trump in the last election, according to a KFF Health News analysis of voting results and enrollment data from Georgetown. Many of these counties are in deep-red states such as Kentucky, Louisiana, and Montana.\nVoters in places like these are more likely to be concerned about government waste, polls show. In one recentnational survey, 75% of Republicans said they think waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid is a major problem.\nThe actual scale of that waste is hotly debated, thoughmany analysts believerelatively few enrollees are abusing the program.\nMountains of mine tailings, or waste, above the valley where Globe, Ariz., is located. The area has been a center for copper mining since the 19th century.Linda Gross for KFF Health Newshide caption\nNevertheless, around Globe, Republican arguments that cuts will streamline Medicaid seemed to resonate.\nRetiree Rick Uhl was stacking chairs and helping clean up after lunch at the senior center.\n\"There's a lot of waste, of money not being accounted for,\" Uhl said. \"I think that's a shame.\"\nUhl said he's been saddened by the political rancor, but he said he's encouraged by the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to cut government spending.\nBack at the street fair downtown, David Sander, who is also retired, said he doubted Medicaid would really be trimmed at all.\n\"I've heard that they really aren't cutting it,\" Sander said. \"That's my understanding.\"\nSander and his wife, Linda, were tending a stall selling embroidery that Linda makes. They also have a neighbor on Medicaid.\n\"She wouldn't be able to live without it,\" Linda Sander said. \"Couldn't afford to have an apartment, make her bills and survive.\"\nKFF Health Newsis a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF— the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",
