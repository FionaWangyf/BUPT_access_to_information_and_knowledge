He went on to found the award-winning politics and culture blog PostBourgie before joining NPR in 2012. Gene is a native of South Philadelphia and an avid runner. He hopes to stay healthy long enough to see his beloved Sixers win an NBA championship.\n\nYou can read Gene's stories here, and follow him on X at @geedee215.\n\nB.A. Parker is a co-host of NPR's Code Switch. She joined the team in July of 2022 and has expertly covered racial trauma in horror films, honoring her ancestors, and the myth behind self-care.\n\nIn a previous life, Parker was a film professor at Morgan State University and Stevenson University, where she forced 19-year-olds to watch Point Break and Wong Kar-wai films.  She then found her way to a production fellowship with This American Life, which she still can't believe happened. She has also been a guest host of NPR's It's Been a Minute and has produced for NPR's Invisibilia, Gimlet's Heavyweight and WNYC's Nancy. In 2019, she was selected for the Third Coast Radio Residency at Ragdale.\n\nParker hails from Baltimore, and currently lives in Brooklyn, NY. You can hear some of her ramblings here, and follow her @aparkusfarce on IG and X.\n\nLori Lizarraga is the co-host of Code Switch. Before public radio, Lori's career was in television. Her work as a local news reporter and evening anchor took her to newsrooms in Texas, California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and abroad on international assignment in Ecuador to become an Emmy and Murrow award-winning broadcast reporter. She left local TV news in 2021 to pursue race and justice reporting full time as an independent journalist. Her investigative reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic uncovered discrimination in local news that resulted in new standards of immigration coverage at newsrooms across the country.\n\nIn 2022, Lori became co-host of Code Switch at NPR, bringing her background in breaking news and a reputation for covering under-reported communities – particularly Latinos in the U.S. – to public radio.\n\nYou can listen to Lori's work here, and follow her on social media at @lorilizarraga.\n\nDalia Mortada is the managing editor and showrunner of Code Switch. She's a (racially ambiguous) child of Syrian immigrants who's lived on three continents and has spent her life straddling cultures, languages, and lived experiences.\n\nBefore joining the Code Switch massive in 2022, she developed editorial strategy for NPR's listening app, edited for NPR's Morning Edition and spent many (literally) sleepless nights editing Up First. She joined NPR in 2018 after living in Istanbul, Turkey, for seven years, where she reported on the Syrian war and refugee crisis, Turkish politics and society, food, fashion, music and more. In her life beyond work, you'll likely find Dalia outside (usually in the mountains) and/or cooking.\n\nYou can read Leah's stories here, and follow her on X at @AskLeezul.\n\nChristina Cala is Code Switch's senior producer. She's a proud Colombiana who strives to put more languages, more accents, and more ways of telling stories in ears everywhere. There's a special spot in her heart for stories about immigrant and indigenous communities, social and climate justice, and all things poetic or musical.\n\nBefore coming to Code Switch, she produced and sometimes edited the TED Radio Hour and All Things Considered. Her reporting on the US-Mexican border was part of a 2019 Edward R. Murrow award-winning package. She's an inaugural Edit Mode fellow and a co-founder of NPR's MGIPOC mentorship program. In 2021, she ran Code Switch's reporting fellowships. When not working, she can be found backpacking, taking all too many pictures, reading a novel a week or making pottery.\n\nYou can listen to Christina's stories here.\n\nYou can find Jess's stories here.\n\nBefore working in journalism, Xavier worked in the non-profit world in Queens, NY, where he was raised and currently resides.

    "title": "What makes manufacturing jobs special? The answer could help rebuild the middle class",
    "content": "Stephanie Scarbrough/Associated Press\n\nStephanie Scarbrough/Associated Press\n\nPoliticians in both big political parties have been trying to reengineer the U.S. economy to boost manufacturing. What makes manufacturing so special? Besides, you know, politics.\n\nSome writers and economists say that romanticizing this one particular sector of the economy is more about nostalgia or political pandering than rational thinking about what will best serve workers and the economy.\n\nPutting aside the debate about whether politicians can successfully bring back a large number of manufacturing jobs — many economists are skeptical of this — we at Planet Money were curious, on a deeper level, about what makes manufacturing special enough to warrant all this ruckus in the first place?\n\nSo we pored over nerdy econ studies and data, and we called up a bunch of economists, including two Nobel laureates.\n\n\"Manufacturing is special,\" says Gordon Hanson, an economist at Harvard Kennedy School who has published influential research on American manufacturing. \" That's because as long as we've been able to measure earnings in the sector, it's just paid workers more, especially workers without a college education.\"\n\nEconomists call this \"the manufacturing premium.\" And it's worth noting that some research suggests that the manufacturing premium has fallen or even disappeared in recent decades.\n\nHowever, Hanson and other economists we spoke to said the most convincing evidence on this subject shows that the manufacturing premium is still alive and well. In particular, they cited a recent, peer-reviewed study from economists David Card, Jesse Rothstein and Moises Yi. Hanson calls it \"the gold standard.\" The economists use much richer, more comprehensive data than previous studies. And they deploy this pretty cool technique that helps them see, systematically, what happened to the pay of over 100 million Americans as they jumped between industries.\n\nNow, it's no secret that industries like tech, finance, law and medicine pay workers a lot. But those high-earners usually have advanced degrees and valuable skills or abilities. Had they not gone into their chosen industry, they would probably have made good money in another industry. It's hard to know how much of their pay is the result of their own special sauce and how much of it is driven by something else in their chosen industry. Like how profitable it is. Where it's located. How unionized it is. The management or culture or size of its companies. Whether it's competitive. And so on.\n\nIt's a similar issue when analyzing manufacturing. The average manufacturing worker makes over $35 an hour, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a lot more than the average earnings of workers at restaurants, which is about $21 an hour. What accounts for this pay difference? The workers themselves or something about these industries?\n\nImagine what would happen if you could run an experiment and you could see, systematically, what happened when you plopped restaurant workers into manufacturing, or vice versa. That's kinda what the economists do in this paper, statistically speaking. And it's not just restaurants and manufacturers. It's basically every industry.\n\nUsing a massive dataset, the economists track what happens to millions and millions of workers as those same workers move to different industries. This allows them to control for age, education and experience, like other studies do, but they can also go a step further. Because they're tracking the same workers, they're controlling for worker qualities that are not easily seen in data — like their grit, their know-how, their work ethic, their rizz.\n\nWith this technique, the economists can cut through more of the noise of why particular industries pay particular workers particular wages. They can get more to the heart of the actual, causal effect on what working in a particular industry can do to people's incomes — in a sense, how special an industry is.\n\nCard, Rothstein and Yi use restaurants as the base industry to compare with other industries. This, they write, is the industry with the lowest average earnings in their data. Think fast-food and cafeteria workers, cooks and servers. The baseline could really be any industry. It's a bit arbitrary because they measure all industry premiums against this same baseline.\n\nYou can think of the industry premiums they find below as basically the pay bump the average person would get from quitting a job in this mostly low-wage service sector and getting one in another industry, without going back to school or dramatically changing the skills or capabilities they already have.\n\nThe economists calculate that, on average, if a worker jumps from working in restaurants to working in manufacturing, they get a 35% pay bump.\n\nThat's a substantial premium, higher than if they went into retail (an 11% premium), education (a 13% premium), agriculture (a 16% premium), health care (a 19% premium), transportation and warehousing (a 24% premium), construction (a 25% premium), finance and insurance (a 32% premium) and professional, scientific and technical services (a 33% premium). Pretty special!\n\nHowever, the manufacturing premium is lower than that of some other sectors, including \"information,\" which includes the movie, publishing, broadcasting and telecommunications industries (a 39% premium); utilities (a 49% premium); and mining, quarrying, oil and gas (a 62% premium). OK, so manufacturing is medium-ish special.\n\nThat said, the 35% percent pay bump in manufacturing is the average for a pretty diverse sector. Manufacturers make all sorts of things: socks, rockets, potato chips, petrochemicals, mannequins, skateboards, electronics, cars, Twinkies, you name it.\n\nSo Card, Rothstein and Yi break down the manufacturing premium, looking at what it is in various subsectors.\n\nThey find that in the low end of the manufacturing spectrum are industries that make apparel and leather (a 15% premium), furniture (a 19% premium) and textile mill and wood products (a 22% premium). Hmmm. Not so special compared with a lot of other industries.\n\nIn the middle are manufacturing subsectors like plastics and rubber (a 30% premium) and food products (a 32% premium). OK, yeah, now we're cooking.\n\nAnd at the high end are industries that manufacture computers and electronics (a 42% premium), transportation equipment, so like cars, ships and planes (a 43% premium), chemicals (a 47% premium) and — the highest of all — petroleum and coal (a 62% premium).\n\nWowzer. That last one especially — that's a big premium. In fact, next to mining, it has the highest premium in all the industries the economists look at. It helps explain why — despite rising concerns about climate change — these fossil fuel-producing jobs are so politically popular in many parts of the United States.\n\nA clear takeaway from this data is that high-end manufacturing offers workers a significant pay bump relative to other industries. Low-end manufacturing, of things like apparel and furniture, not so much.\n\nCard, Rothstein and Yi don't provide definitive answers for why manufacturing pays a premium. There are many plausible explanations.\n\nOne is that manufacturing has a history of being a more unionized sector, which led to higher pay and benefits. A core idea here is unions force business owners and managers to share more of their profits with workers.\n\nDaron Acemoglu, the 2024 winner of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, told us he believes manufacturing is special because, at least historically, it has been a union bastion.\n\n\" Manufacturing is super important for unionization,\" Acemoglu says. \"So if you want to have unions in your economy, you want manufacturing. They unionize themselves and they unionize other sectors.\"\n\nSome pro-union advocates have gone so far as to argue that Americans are nostalgic for an era of lots of manufacturing jobs not because they were good jobs per se, but because they were good, union jobs. The implication: Promote unions, not manufacturing.\n\nHowever, it's also true that the unionization rate in manufacturing has fallen pretty precipitously in the United States and that many manufacturing plants are not unionized, especially in the Midwest and South, where a lot of states have passed laws that make unionizing more difficult.\n\nIn fact, in 2023, only about 7.9% of manufacturing workers were unionized, which is not crazy different from the overall union membership rate in the private sector, which stood at about 5.9%.\n\nAnother potential hypothesis for why there's a manufacturing premium: Working in factories may be more dangerous than working in a lot of service jobs, and so manufacturers may have to pay a premium to attract workers willing to take on greater risk (economists call this a \"compensating differential\"). This is a classic explanation for why coal mining pays a premium.\n\nHowever, the data doesn't seem to really support this hypothesis in manufacturing. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2023 the fatal injury rate in manufacturing was 2.5 per 100,000 workers. That's slightly higher than industries like restaurants (1.6), retail trade (2.1) and leisure and hospitality (2.3) but well under construction (9.6), transportation and warehousing (12.9) and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting (20.3). Manufacturing also doesn't look particularly more dangerous than other sectors when it comes to nonfatal injuries or illnesses.\n\nThe Pew Research Center recently did a survey that suggested that manufacturing workers are among a more general group of \"blue-collar\" workers who are more dissatisfied with their jobs than the rest of the workforce. This group also includes those who do manual or physical labor in sectors like mining, agriculture, retail, transportation, construction and restaurants.\n\nA 2024 Gallup survey found that only 23% of manufacturing workers felt engaged or enthusiastic about their jobs. That was lower than the overall workforce (31%). But it was also lower than some other blue-collar industries, including construction (32%), utilities (30%) and agriculture and mining (29%).\n\nDislike of factory work might help explain why, despite manufacturing paying a premium, many workers aren't filling these jobs — which may actually increase the size of the premium that manufacturers have to pay to find people to do them.\n\nThe last big reason that manufacturing may pay a premium: Manufacturing workers handle a lot of expensive machinery. Most of the economists we spoke to stressed this factor. It helps explain the pattern in the premium data we went through before, where more advanced manufacturing — which is filled with a lot of expensive machines — pays an even higher premium.\n\nFor one, employers may have to pay more to attract people whom they can trust will be careful with their expensive machinery and not screw up productivity on the assembly line. The machines that workers have to operate, Card says, are oftentimes very expensive, \"so you don't want someone goofing off.\"\n\nOr, worse yet, you don't want workers to intentionally damage this expensive equipment. Rothstein, a co-author of this study and another economist at UC Berkeley, says this fear was more relevant back in the day, when there were violent industrial conflicts. Today, probably not as much. But, he says, it's still true that \"the more capital-intensive you are, the more damage workers can do to you if they decide to go to war against you.\" Don't get these workers angry!\n\nTeaching these skills takes time and money. So maybe employers pay extra to convince workers to not quit and to lower their turnover rates. They also may use higher wages to motivate employees to work hard and be diligent because it's hard to monitor huge factory floors (this is known in economics as the \"efficiency wage hypothesis,\" a theory that employers pay extra to accomplish workforce goals like these).\n\nMore generally, working with machinery often means you're productive, and productivity is one important factor influencing pay. Also, these advanced manufacturers with expensive machinery are often big, profitable companies.\n\n\" The kind of standard way that economists have always thought about this is that big firms and capital-intensive production are both good for wages,\" Rothstein says. \"And that's manufacturing, especially advanced manufacturing,\"\n\nWhatever the reason, according to this research, manufacturing does continue to pay a premium and especially so in advanced manufacturing, where there's a lot of expensive equipment. Pretty special!\n\nGordon Hanson, together with UC Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti, recently did a study in which they use a measure of industry pay premiums, similar to Card, Rothstein and Yi, to see which industries have provided good jobs to Americans over the last five decades.\n\nNow, their definition of \"good jobs\" isn't really how we typically talk about good jobs. Like Card, Rothstein and Yi, they control for worker characteristics when calculating which industries provide jobs with a high pay premium. That takes the focus away from higher education and credentialed skills as the tickets to a well-paying job, because it's holding things like that constant. It's no secret higher education pays in today's job market.\n\nIn this paper, what they're really interested in, Hanson says, is \"the job market lottery.\" That is, if you don't necessarily have a college degree and if market forces in the job market are kinda stacked against you, which industries allow you to win the lottery and reach the middle class? They define good jobs as those that pay high premiums (in the top third), meaning there's something about these industries that gives workers a big extra pay bump regardless of their background.\n\nWith this definition of good jobs, they find that, back in 1980, manufacturing accounted for almost 40% of all good jobs in America. That was for both college- and non-college-educated workers. It's a pretty stunning statistic.\n\nThe economists find — not surprisingly — that manufacturing's portion of the nation's good jobs has fallen dramatically over the past few decades as those jobs were automated and offshored away.\n\nToday, manufacturing accounts for only about 10% of the American workforce. Yet, with this measure, it accounts for about 20% of all good jobs in America. Manufacturing punches far above its weight when it comes to industries that provide an extra pay bump to Americans.\n\nSo, yeah, Hanson says, manufacturing jobs are special. But over the last few decades many have disappeared. And opportunities for non-college-educated Americans — who represent more than half the workforce — shriveled. The one bright spot, the economists find, was in construction and the skilled trades.\n\nMeanwhile, good jobs in industries like finance, tech, management and legal services blossomed. These sectors are weird though, Hanson says. They provide tons of opportunities to workers with a college education but very few to those without one.\n\n\" There are certain types of industries where you can't unlock the productivity magic box without a college degree,\" Hanson says. \" In manufacturing, you can open the magic box without a college degree.\"\n\nDoes that mean the government should do everything it can to boost this one sector?\n\nMany economists doubt whether the government can do much to dramatically boost the number of manufacturing jobs in the country. For one, many of these jobs have become automated with machines in recent years, and fewer workers are needed. Tariffs might help bring some of these jobs back. But tariffs and the trade retaliation they invite could also hurt other areas of the economy that also provide good jobs — including in American manufacturing, where companies often need foreign parts and materials to efficiently make things in America.\n\nTariffs also raise prices for everyone, including working-class Americans who make less income and will feel it the most.\n\n\"I think we've developed a kind of collective fetish for manufacturing, which is really unproductive,\" Hanson says. \"The problem is not too few manufacturing jobs. The problem is too few jobs for workers without a college education.\"\n\nHanson says, sure, we should try to create more good jobs in manufacturing. He — like many other economists — is skeptical whether we can bring back labor-intensive manufacturing, like in apparel and furniture. And as we showed before, those pay low premiums anyways. They're not a great source of high-paying jobs. And, Hanson says, these jobs are likely not going to come back, because cheap labor is really important to their business model. Slapping tariffs on this stuff, Hanson says, will mean \"we're just gonna charge U.S. consumers a whole lot more for the privilege of consuming T-shirts and tennis shoes and board games and the like.\"\n\nAmerica continues to have a high-end manufacturing sector that produces things like cars, planes and petrochemicals. And Hanson says we may \"have a shot\" at bringing back some manufacturing jobs in the middle, which produce things like auto parts and machine tools. He says he's open to the idea that strategic, temporary tariffs can help make that happen. He, however, thinks it's much more important for America to invest in workforce development programs, like reforming high school education to offer kids more routes to get vocational skills, and investing in community college programs and apprenticeships to equip Americans with the skills needed to be productive in manufacturing.\n\nBut the reality, Hanson says, is that manufacturing is only a small slice of the economy — and it will always be a small slice of the economy. So, he says, leaders should be focusing a lot more on creating good jobs in services, because \"most of the good jobs are going to have to be in services.\"\n\nAnd that could mean trying to replicate some of the things that have made manufacturing jobs special. Like potentially reinvigorating unions, or trying to get more high-paying industries with lots of advanced technology and machinery to open their doors to people without a college education. Hanson imagines companies and the government figuring out more ways to create good jobs for non-college-educated folks in sectors like tech or health care. Our education system and emerging technology could help make that happen.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you or you're reading online, you can sign up here.",

    "title": "American doctors look to relocate to Canada to avoid the Trump administration",
    "content": "Earlier this year, as President Donald Trump was beginning to reshape the American government, Michael, an emergency room doctor who was born, raised, and trained in the United States, packed up his family and left the country.\n\nShots - Health News \nAfter CDC cuts, doctors fear women will lose access to contraception research\n\nShots - Health News \nAfter CDC cuts, doctors fear women will lose access to contraception research\n\nShots - Health News \nAfter CDC cuts, doctors fear women will lose access to contraception research\n\nMichael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.\n\n\"Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,\" Michael said. \"And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.\"\n\nTreatments \nAs a diversity grant dies, young scientists fear it will haunt their careers\n\nTreatments \nAs a diversity grant dies, young scientists fear it will haunt their careers\n\nTreatments \nAs a diversity grant dies, young scientists fear it will haunt their careers\n\nMichael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.\n\nThe Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is \"typically the first step\" to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada's most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.\n\n\"The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they're Americans,\" said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. \"They state that right out of the gate: 'I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.'\"\n\nCanada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American healthcare system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.\n\nThe Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors' leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their \"citizenship status,\" then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.\n\nPhilpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.\n\nPhilpott said CanAm has seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs between January and April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.\n\nRohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.\n\n\"They're ready to move to Canada tomorrow,\" she said. \"They are not concerned about what their income is.\"\n\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada's most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.\n\nBritish Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.\n\nQuebec's College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada \"specifically because of the actual presidential administration.\"\n\nMichael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he describes as escalating right-wing political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.\n\nMichael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.\n\n\"Civil discourse was falling apart,\" he said. \"I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.\"\n\nIt then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was \"not difficult,\" he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.\n\n\"The process wasn't any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,\" Michael said. \"The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don't want to go through that process again.\"\n\nMichael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.\n\nThis desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.\n\nThe company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was \"terrified that Trump would win again.\" For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conducting telemedicine from afar, Bapat said.\n\nBut after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.\n\n\"Previously it had been about adventure,\" Bapat said. \"But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.\"\n\nAt least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.\n\nDoctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada's worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.\n\nThe campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises \"zero political interference in physician patient relationship\" as a selling point.\n\nAlison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America's for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.\n\nCarleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.\n\nShe dropped her American citizenship last year.\n\n\"People I know have said, 'You left just in time,'\" Carleton said. \"I tell people, 'I know. When are you going to move?'\"\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

Let's talk about a few basics.\n\nThink about sound. We're challenging you to work with sounds — interviews, narration and recorded sounds from the world around you.\n\nHow many people do we need, and what roles are involved?\n\nYou can divide up these duties in a way that makes sense for the size of your team. You might decide to have multiple people host and multiple people work as producers.\n\nWhat does it mean to mix audio?\n\nMixing is the process of editing and arranging audio clips in a way that sounds seamless and natural to a listener. After you and your team record sounds from interviews, events or other sources, you'll need to arrange them in a sound-editing software, like Audacity, which you can download online free of charge.\n\nI've been reading lots of training guides that use tons of words I don't know. Help!\n\nYou can record sounds, conversations or interviews with sound recording apps on your smartphone.\n\nYou can also use your phone's built-in recording app. If you've got an iPhone, go to your \"utilities\" folder and click on \"voice memos\" to begin recording.\n\nYou'll want to make sure you have enough storage on your phone to do this and that you can either email the sound file to yourself or plug your phone into the computer to upload the recording.\n\nNPR has a handy guide to recording audio with your phone. You can find it here. And here's another: Check out the YR Media guide How to Record High-Quality Audio With Your Phone.\n\nNPR has a handy guide to recording audio with your phone.

Not too close, but not more than a few inches away, either.\n\n2. A computer with sound editing software\n\nIf your school already provides editing software on the computers, feel free to use that. If not, we recommend Audacity, which is a free software download available online. You can download it here. As you learn to use it, lots of tutorials are available from Audacity.\n\nThe team at YR Media has put together a video about recording sound and setting up equipment.

As you listen, think about the different ways that these segments are structured. Is there a host? Is it an interview style — or is a narrator telling a story, with clips of interviews in between?\n\nMorning Edition: Reporting Live From Miami: A Bunch Of Fourth-Graders Tell Their Teacher's Story\n\nHidden Brain: The Haunting Effects of Going Days Without Sleep\n\nHidden Brain: How Labels Can Affect People's Personalities and Potential\n\nHow I Built This: Instagram: Kevin Systrom & Mike Krieger\n\nNow that you've listened to a few examples, start to gather ideas. We've given you a few prompts to get you thinking. They aren't required, but you may choose to use them.\n\nIf you're telling a story, it may help to think of the parts of the story in separate sections. Check out this guide to structuring your story — and another about telling a story in three acts.\n\nIf you're telling a story, it may help to think of the parts of the story in separate sections.

Check out this guide to structuring your story — and another about telling a story in three acts.\n\nNow it's time to start thinking about the sounds that you'll use. Regardless of how your project is structured, it helps to feature a variety of sounds.\n\nCompile a list of sounds you'd like to record — and bring that list with you when you go into the field.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of radio pieces that use sounds to add to the story.\n\nListen to this \"Radio Field Trip\" from New Hampshire Public Radio. What sounds do you hear? There's narration from the show's host, Rick Ganley — but there's a lot more than that.\n\nAnd here's this one, from Radio Rookies, a series from WNYC.

Although independent advisers have been reconsidering the COVID vaccine recommendations, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn't scheduled to meet until later this month to make a recommendation.\n\nIn response to questions on this issue, Department of Health and Human Services press secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano shared the following statement: \"HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans—especially our nation's children.\"\n\nSince the vaccines became available, the government has been recommending the shots for nearly everyone, including children and pregnant people.

The commission, chaired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., enlisted various Cabinet members, including the secretaries of agriculture and education and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and met in private over the last few months.\n\n\"There is something wrong and we will not stop until we defeat the chronic disease epidemic,\" Trump said at a White House event on Thursday, flanked by Secretary Kennedy and other members of the commission.\n\nMuch of what's detailed reflects the views Kennedy has articulated during his many public appearances.\n\nThe report identifies four major drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic illness: poor diet, environmental chemicals, chronic stress and lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization. In keeping with the messaging that has animated the MAHA platform, the report pins much of the blame on conflicts of interest and corporate influence in the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nThe report lays the groundwork for the MAHA commission to develop a strategy for addressing childhood disease, which is supposed to happen by mid August according to the February executive order.\n\nThe proposition that nutrition, lifestyle and exposure to pollution and other harmful chemicals are conspiring to harm children's health is not controversial among longtime researchers in public health.\n\n\"Many of us have been calling for some attention to these issues for decades now,\" says Dr. James Perrin, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. \"This is a real American problem, and it's not one that we're seeing quite so dramatically in other countries.\"\n\nBut the report doesn't resolve some of the central tensions that have characterized Kennedy's MAHA platform from the outset.\n\n\"They make a great diagnosis and they have a very weak treatment plan,\" says Dr. Philip Landrigan, a professor of pediatrics and public health at Boston College.\n\nAmong the concerns: The report doesn't contain a thorough discussion of the socioeconomic factors like poverty, which is a key predictor of chronic disease.\n\n\"They acknowledge that ultra-processed foods are cheaper, but aren't acknowledging that growing poverty and the wealth gap is leading more people, and children, to relying on cheaper foods,\" says Carmen Marsit, a professor of environmental health at Emory University.\n\nThe report also questions vaccine safety and suggests that possible links to childhood disease have not been thoroughly studied.\n\n\"That is simply not true. There have been abundant studies,\" says Landrigan.\n\nMore broadly, the emphasis on advancing research and public health initiatives runs counter to many of the recent actions taken by the Trump administration.\n\nFor example, the report outlines the risks of exposure to harmful chemicals on children's health — an area that Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, says deserves much more attention. And yet the Trump administration is cutting staff at key agencies and dissolving an office in the Environmental Protection Agency that studies the toxic effects of chemicals.\n\nShe agrees with the overarching theme that our medical system and our research infrastructure is too focused on treating these diseases and finding cures.\n\n\"We really need to move more into a prevention model,\" says Sathyanarayana.\n\n\"But some of the actions they have taken actually undermine prevention,\" she says.\n\nAs head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has directed the firing of thousands of federal workers, cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and elimination of billions of dollars of contracts and grants from the National Institutes of Health, all of which support the kind of research and data that underlie the report.\n\nDr. William Dietz, a childhood obesity researcher at the George Washington University, says the MAHA commission's emphasis on the harms of ultra-processed foods is warranted, though the report paints the topic with a broad brush, when, in fact, certain processed foods are more problematic than others.\n\nHowever, he worries the federal government may not even be able to accurately track its progress on obesity in the future.\n\n\"I'm really concerned the scalpel that's been taken to CDC in general threatens the ongoing ability to monitor health. And those are going to be some of the same data sets that are needed to assess progress in many of these areas,\" he says.\n\nThe report reserves space at the very end to sketch out a range of proposed solutions: Asking the National Institutes of Health to fund new trials on whole-food diets and on potentially harmful ingredients in the food supply; pushing NIH and the Food and Drug Administration to improve post-marketing surveillance of pediatric drugs; supporting new pediatric drug safety research; and launching a national lifestyle-medicine initiative.\n\nIt's not clear where the funds or staffing would come from for these priorities.\n\nLauren Wisk, who studies chronic disease in children at UCLA, says the numbers cited on the rates of childhood disease are \"reasonable.\"\n\nBut she worries about Kennedy's rhetoric that seems to favor the idea of \"magic bullets\" like eliminating food dyes instead of focusing on large-scale programs that provide access to healthy food for low-income families or tackle air pollution, which is linked to asthma and other conditions.\n\n\"This administration has not been as excited to talk about the social policies that need to be in place to address onset of pediatric disease,\" she says.\n\n\"They have been looking at things that are splashier, easier to point the finger at, but when you actually think about the epidemiology of this — it's not going to be the most effective strategy if they want to be serious about curbing the issue.\"",

Since the active compounds can degrade and lose their effectiveness, slathering on old lotion or spray is one mistake people make when trying to protect their skin.\n\nEach year about 84,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with melanoma and more than 8,000 die from this type of skin cancer. In addition, millions of cases of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are diagnosed each year, and about  90% of these skin cancers are linked to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.\n\nUsing sunscreen plays a \"key role\" in protecting your skin, according to the American Academy of Dermatology Association. So, we asked dermatologists to share their tips to optimize protection and we learned about the common misperceptions they hear from patients.\n\nResearch shows some of the active ingredients used in chemical sunscreens are absorbed into the bloodstream, and the FDA has been conducting a safety review.  The agency says there's \"inadequate data\" to support a safety finding for some chemicals such as oxybenzone, but there's also no evidence of harm.  And most dermatologists say the risk of sunburn likely far outweighs any potential risk from sunscreen chemicals. Still, if you're concerned there are options to avoid these compounds.\n\nAlternatives include physical sunscreens, also called mineral sunscreens,  made from zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which can physically block UV light.\n\n\"I think that zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are much safer than chemical sunscreens because they're so inert,\" says Dr.Tola Oyesanya, a dermatologist with Kaiser Permanente in the Baltimore area. She says mineral sunblocks are better for sensitive skin since they're less likely to irritate.\n\nTo avoid the \"1980s lifeguard look\" with the thick, white paste, there are more zinc oxide products available now that are much clearer, and more \"cosmetically elegant,\" says Dr. Jennifer Holman, a dermatologist and fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nDr. Ida Orengo, chair of the Department of Dermatology at Baylor College of Medicine says, unlike chemical sunscreens, these mineral-based sunblocks can stay on the surface of the skin and \"act as a shield or barrier\" to deflect sunlight.\n\nAnd the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says sunscreens without chemicals are better for coral reefs and marine life.\n\nLife Kit \nHow to pick the right sunscreen for you\n\nLife Kit \nHow to pick the right sunscreen for you\n\nLife Kit \nHow to pick the right sunscreen for you\n\nA sunscreen with an SPF, or sun protection factor, of 15 blocks about 93% of UV rays, and when you bump up to SPF 30, you're blocking about 97% of UV rays. Higher than that, \"you're not getting a whole lot more sun protection,\" Dr. Orengo says.\n\n\"SPF 30 is sufficient,\" says Dr. Oyesanya. \"There's no sunscreen that filters 100% of the sun's rays, so 97% is pretty good,\"she says.  Rather than focus on SPF, Oyesanya says pay attention to the amount of sunscreen you apply. Skimping is one of the mistakes many people make.\n\nSo, here's a guide: Apply the equivalent of a shot glass  which is about 1.5 ounces of liquid sunscreen to cover both your body and face. If you are just covering your face use about a teaspoon.\n\n\"Spray sunscreens are a bit risky because it's easy to miss a whole area of your body, especially if you're applying it outside in the wind, Oyesanya says. \"Make sure your skin is just totally wet in all the areas that you need to cover,\" she says, since there isn't an easy way to measure the amount of spray you've applied.\n\nMany people use SPF 50, or even higher sun protection factor products, and assume it gives them longer lasting protection.  \"The misconception is that it lasts twice as long. It's not true,\" says Dr. Gregory Papadeas, a dermatologist in  Denver, Colorado.\n\nEven higher SPF sunscreens need frequent reapplication.  \"You wear them off, especially if you're swimming or sweating,\" says Dr. Orengo.\n\nDermatologists recommend that people reapply sunscreen every 2 hours to ensure full protection. Papadeas says, in his household, they buy new sunscreen products each season, since \"the chemicals become weaker\" and are less effective over time. So, look for the expiration date, or better yet, restock with new products at the beginning of summer.\n\nBook News & Features \nHere are 19 books our critics are excited for this summer\n\nBook News & Features \nHere are 19 books our critics are excited for this summer\n\nBook News & Features \nHere are 19 books our critics are excited for this summer\n\nPop Culture Happy Hour \nThese are the new movies and TV shows we can't wait to watch this summer\n\nPop Culture Happy Hour \nThese are the new movies and TV shows we can't wait to watch this summer\n\nPop Culture Happy Hour \nThese are the new movies and TV shows we can't wait to watch this summer\n\nLots of people assume clouds protect them from the sun and forget to put on sun protection. But it's easy to get sunburned on an overcast day.\n\nClouds block about 20% of the sunlight, explains Dr. Holman. \"You're still getting about 80% of the UV rays filtered through those clouds,\" Holman says. \"You absolutely can still experience damage from UV radiation on a cloudy day.\" So, even when it's overcast, remember to keep some sunscreen handy.\n\nBut it's best not to store your sunscreen in hot places such as the trunk or glove box of your car. \"When sunscreen is kept in a hot place, the sunscreen is actually being degraded by heat,\" says Dr. Oyesanya. It's best to store it in a cool, dry place, to have it last throughout the season.\n\nBaseball caps can protect your forehead, but other parts of your face are exposed. If you want sun protection from a hat, \"we always recommend a three inch brim hat that's [made from] a tightly woven material,\" says Dr. Orengo.\n\nThe sun can damage your eyes, as well. According to doctors at Johns Hopkins University, even one day in the sun can burn the cornea, and over time, sun exposure can cause cataracts. The optimal way to protect your eyes is to wear sunglasses that provide 100% UV protection, according to the Hopkins doctors.\n\nThere are lots of shirts, hats and other clothing that have sun protection built into the fabric, from brands including Columbia, Cotopaxi, Sombra  and Mott50. Dr. Orengo also tells her patients about Sun Guard, a powder you can put into your washing machine to coat your clothes with a chemical sunscreen, giving your washed clothing a SPF of 30, which lasts through multiple washes. And, one more product that may appeal to families with young children:  UV stickers that you place on your skin. These stickers change colors when it's time to reapply sunscreen.\n\nWith the exception of babies under 6 months old, sunscreen is recommended for all groups. Although fair-skinned people can be more prone to sunburns, all skin types are vulnerable to damage from the ultraviolet radiation from the sun.  \"I've cut skin cancers off of every skin type \" says Dr. Jennifer Holman.\n\nThe risk of melanoma in someone with dark skin is certainly less than someone who has lighter skin, says Dr. Oyesanya, \"but it's not impossible.\" She says people with darker skin who've had a lot of sun exposure should be careful to check their palms, the soles of the feet, nails,  inside their mouth, and their toenails.  \"These are all areas where you can develop skin cancer, and that's because there's less melanin in those areas,\"  she says.\n\nHealth \nSun's out, ticks out.

Novavax's shot targets a JN.1 strain.\n\nThe committee was uncertain about which particular JN.1 subvariant would be the best pick because it isn't known which strain may be dominant by the fall. The FDA will now work with the companies to make a final decision, officials said.\n\nThe advisory panel's vote is consistent with the World Health Organization's recommendation for the next set of vaccines.\n\nThe decision underscores the state of the evolution of the virus, which has now essentially become endemic in the U.S. and other countries. The virus continues to produce new subvariants of omicron instead of evolving into dramatically different strains that would pose a greater risk.\n\nThe recommendation comes two days after the FDA announced a new approach to COVID vaccines that would likely restrict access to the shots. While many questions remain about the new strategy, a change in strains would not appear to make a difference in how the FDA approves the next vaccines.\n\nThe new strategy would continue the current vaccine approval process for people ages 65 and older and younger people with health problems that put them at high risk for serious complications from the virus. Those health problems include obesity, heart disease, cancer, inactivity and other risk factors. That regulatory approach relies on information about how the immune system responds to the vaccines.\n\nBut the FDA will now require vaccine manufacturers to conduct large, costly additional studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines for children and younger healthy adults by comparing them to a harmless injection of saline. Those trials would look at differences in health outcomes, such as developing COVID.\n\nThat's a major change from the current approach, which recommends and approves the vaccines for almost everyone based on the more easily obtained immune system studies.\n\nFDA officials say the change was prompted by the widespread immunity to the virus that people have developed because of repeated infections and vaccinations. This acquired immunity has contributed to a significant drop in serious illness and death from COVID. The FDA estimates 100 million to 200 million Americans would be eligible for COVID vaccines under the new approach.\n\nSome independent experts are welcoming the change. Others, however, worry the move would make it harder for many people who still want the vaccine to get it. That would include parents who want to vaccinate very young children and those who want to reduce their risk for mild or moderate illness, long COVID and the risk of spreading the virus to other people, such as older relatives.\n\nFDA officials say the steps will bring the U.S. in line with the approach that other high-income countries take towards the vaccines and are necessary to restore trust in the vaccines.\n\nEven though COVID is still claiming more lives than the flu, most U.S. adults have declined to get vaccinated against COVID in recent years and even fewer parents have opted to vaccinate their children. Children tend to be far less likely to get seriously ill from COVID, but the disease can still be serious for them, especially very young children.",

She says she uses the guidelines \"pretty much every time\" she sees a patient for contraceptive care.\n\nOther doctors describe feeling equally shocked. \"I mean, there is no other resource that is doing this,\" says Dr. Andrea Braden, an obstetrician in Atlanta, Georgia. \"All the OB-GYN's use it.\"\n\nPublic Health \nIn a reversal, the Trump administration restores funding for women's health study\n\nPublic Health \nIn a reversal, the Trump administration restores funding for women's health study\n\nPublic Health \nIn a reversal, the Trump administration restores funding for women's health study\n\nRepresentatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Trump administration did not explain why the CDC team was cut. It was eliminated in April as part of the reduction of the Women's Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.\n\nNPR reached out to HHS for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.\n\nBusy doctors who are seeing many patients, says Braden, simply do not have time to comb through all the latest medical research. So, the CDC team made recommendations available in an app that doctors could download and easily reference with questions about contraception, including how to navigate the topic for patients with specific conditions and diseases. It was downloaded 440,000 times, according to the CDC.\n\n\"The app was just a game changer for us,\" says Braden. \"That was very clearly organized, really easy to digest, and it was such a nice quick reference for us. It was a resource that we all trusted intuitively.\"\n\nThe current guidelines are still accessible, while the team charged with updating them no longer exists.\n\nDoctors caution that even though the recommendations were issued relatively recently, without careful monitoring they will soon be out of date. \" Medicine is not static,\" says Dr. Deva Sharma, a hematologist who said the guidelines are a critical part of her medical practice. \"It's constantly evolving and improving.\"\n\nThe team issued guidelines most recently in 2024. One example of a change that Braden says had a significant impact on her conversations with her patients is around recommendations for breastfeeding mothers using birth control. The new guidelines for the first time acknowledged that some contraception can jeopardize milk supply in nursing mothers.\n\nThis update, she says, represented a sea change in a way of thinking about the importance of empowering patients to make their own decisions about breastfeeding. \" That was such an important aspect of the update,\" says Braden. \"It helped us guide our practice, rather than tell people what they need after they have a baby. It really put the patient at the center of the conversation.\"\n\nFor some patients and doctors dealing with specific conditions, conversations about contraception can be matters of life or death. Sharma specializes in treating women with Sickle Cell disease — an inherited red blood cell disorder — which puts patients at a much greater risk of life threatening complications in pregnancy than people without the disease.\n\nSharma calls the termination of the CDC team \"detrimental to women's health,\" and also recalls vividly the moment she found out when a colleague sent her a message. \"I remember just feeling overwhelmed and devastated,\" says Sharma.\n\nIn the recent guidelines, the CDC team changed recommendations for women with Sickle Cell Disease, which already puts patients at increased risk for blood clots. Doctors who treat this disease say they now rarely prescribe certain forms of contraception to their patients due to new evidence suggesting these kinds of treatments can create an even greater risk.\n\nBraden says she is still feeling confused as to why such a valuable resource was eliminated. \" I don't understand,\" she says \"Why them? Why this sector of medicine? This is a waste.\"\n\nShe warns that doctors will not be able to compensate for the medical updates that this guide provides. \" Medicine changes so quickly and it is very difficult to keep up with all of it,\" she warns. \"New data comes out — new research comes out — and we find out that there's a better way to do things. Contraceptive medicine is no different from that.\"\n\nMissing treatment options are hard to measure\n\nMany patients will not necessarily know about medical updates they do not benefit from, but Teonna Woolford is one patient who does understand the utility of the CDC's guidelines around contraception.\n\nShots - Health News \nFor patients with sickle cell disease, fertility care is about reproductive justice\n\nShots - Health News \nFor patients with sickle cell disease, fertility care is about reproductive justice\n\nShots - Health News \nFor patients with sickle cell disease, fertility care is about reproductive justice\n\nBorn with Sickle Cell Disease, Woolford started a non-profit, Sickle Cell Reproductive Education Directive, that advocates for patients like herself. Woolford says the disease is often characterized by uncertainty and difficulty in making hard decisions around treatment.\n\n\"Having the guidelines was really like a proactive approach to addressing contraception,\" says Woolford. \"There are a lot of knowledge and research gaps on this subject.\"\n\nSickle Cell Disease disproportionately affects people of color, a group that Woolford notes has not historically enjoyed parity in reproductive justice. \"The removal of the CDC team to me just reminds me of darker times in our history when people of color were oppressed,\" she says.\n\nBlack women in the United States have disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality.\n\nDr. Braden sees the team's elimination as a setback to women everywhere. \"It really hurts those of us in women's health — to target something like contraceptives.\" says Braden. \"This is basic healthcare for OBGYNs and it was really defeating. I would say I felt angry and sad and confused.\"\n\nShe and other doctors point out that many women in the U.S. can no longer legally terminate pregnancy. They say that makes it especially important for them to be able to make an informed choice about the best ways to prevent becoming pregnant in the first place.\n\n\" Bodily autonomy has been taken away from women in various states,\" says Dr. Sharma, who practices in Tennessee — a state with strict abortion laws. \"We've slashed people's rights to make decisions,\" she says. \"Now we're taking away evidence-based recommendations.\"",

Secretary General Kofi Annan as he was working to get the issue onto the global health agenda in 2015.\n\nEach year, roughly 140,000 people die from snakebite 'envenoming' (basically, when a venomous snake delivers venom into the body through a bite or spray). Another 2 to 3 million are bitten each year and survive but can face serious injury or long-term disability as a result.\n\nIn 2017, the World Health Organization recognized snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease. \"Since then, only limited progress has been made,\" said David Lalloo, vice chancellor of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.\n\nThat's where the snake statues come in.\n\nAs part of an effort to put the dangers of snakebite back on the agenda, Lalloo and a group of global health experts launched Strike Out Snakebite at the World Health Forum that wrapped up this week in Geneva. To garner attention, the initiative erected eight large snake statues around the city.\n\nNPR spoke with Lalloo, who has worked on snakebite for about 30 years, about the statues, the hidden burden of snakebites and what the initiative aims to achieve.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSo I've got to start with the snake statues. What's the deal there?\n\nThey were pretty spectacularly colored and colorful and pretty large. I actually saw them before I knew they were part of the initiative. I thought, this is really weird. There was no label at that point, so you just saw this snake in the middle of the park.\n\n\"Silent Fang\" is the name of this snake sculpture displayed in Geneva — a term used to draw attention to the dangers of snakebite.

People generally are fascinated by snakes, they either love them or hate them but are fascinated. So these are a very effective way of capturing their attention, to get the general public behind this as an issue.\n\nI think a lot of people don't think of snakebite as a major global health problem. Why does it deserve more attention?\n\nSnakebite is a problem that's very much hidden to the broader populations living in cities and to health planners because it does affect the poorest of the communities in the poorest areas of relatively poor countries. The challenge is that almost all of those individuals live in rural areas, often going about their daily work in the fields.\n\nBecause it occurs in such remote areas, we don't have very good statistics. And so it's very much under-recognized as a big problem.\n\nWhat can happen when someone gets bitten by a venomous snake?\n\nThere's a wide variety of effects.\n\nSome venomous snakes will cause a lot of local swelling, occasionally you can get quite significant tissue damage. If you get tissue breakdown, you may get ulcers, you may lose the skin. Those will not always heal well, particularly if you haven't got very good surgical facilities, so people can lose function of an arm or a leg because of snakebite. That can have a huge impact on their life, and their family's life, if they're the breadwinner.\n\nA statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n\nA statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n\nA statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nA statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nA statue of Russell's Viper — a venomous snake that lives in south and southeast Asia.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAnd then you can have severe neurotoxicity [damage to the nervous system] that stops breathing or causes blood clotting problems. People will die from severe neurotoxicity and sometimes from bleeding or shock.\n\nThere's some really interesting evidence on psychological morbidity as well, that people after snakebite have depression or post-traumatic stress disorders.\n\nWhat was the goal of the Strike Out Snakebite initiative at the World Health Assembly this week?\n\nThe ultimate goal is that every adult and child that needs an antivenom gets a high quality antivenom delivered to them rapidly. The steps on the way to that are to, first of all, have a choice of different antivenoms we know are both effective and safe, and to have supply chain systems that will get those to the patients that need them.\n\nAlongside that, you'll have a workforce that is well-trained, that is familiar with how you manage snakebite. And then I think we'll have clear education campaigns for the population about how they avoid snakebite and what they do if they get snakebite.\n\nIn 2019, WHO developed a roadmap for snakebite envenoming. It was estimated that about $140 million would be necessary to achieve that. In reality, only between 10% to 15% of that funding has been achieved. This initiative is very much an attempt to ultimately just put snakebite back on the map and highlight where we need investment to make a big difference to this disease.\n\nWhat's the current state of treatment?\n\nAntivenoms are the mainstay of treatment, and they're made by putting snake venom into an animal, usually a horse or sheep. Then you take the blood from the animal, you process that and make it into an antivenom.\n\nScience \nHe let snakes bite him some 200 times to create a better snakebite antivenom\n\nScience \nHe let snakes bite him some 200 times to create a better snakebite antivenom\n\nScience \nHe let snakes bite him some 200 times to create a better snakebite antivenom\n\nBut the venom of different species is very, very different indeed. The venom of Asian snakes is completely different to that of African snakes. And even across the African continent, the venom of different species will vary quite considerably. So that has to be taken into account when you're making antivenoms and when you're distributing antivenoms.\n\nOne of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n\nOne of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n\nOne of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nOne of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nOne of the snake statues on display in a park near Lake Geneva.\n                \n                    \n                    Owen Davies/Getty Images for The Strike Out Global Initiative/Getty Images Europe\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAnother challenge with antivenoms, particularly in Africa, is that they have not always been very well regulated. So there've been poor quality or ineffective antivenoms around. So the number of people, particularly in Africa, that have access to effective, high quality antivenoms is very low indeed. Even when there are good antivenoms available, they tend to be very expensive and way beyond the affordability for many health systems.\n\nAre there efforts to develop newer vaccines?\n\nThere's a lot of work trying to specifically target antibody molecules against the toxins, rather than being pretty crude and sticking venom into a horse.\n\nThere are also efforts to develop drugs that will neutralize some of these toxins. The advantage of a drug is that they could potentially be given by mouth in very remote settings, whereas antivenom needs to be given into the vein. And you can only do that in bigger health clinics or hospitals. And so a drug that you could give in a very remote area would potentially be life-saving. Because most people are bitten in rural areas, it takes a long time to reach full health facilities.\n\nWhat about delivering care, what can be improved there?\n\nI think there's some very simple stuff that could be done on training of both medical personnel and the population.\n\nThere's also this element of educating populations about prevention — how do you prevent snakes biting you? When is the most dangerous time for snakes to bite? Are there things you can do to protect, seal your hut or your house to stop snakes [from] coming inside?\n\nThere's also a need to educate the population so that they know that if they have a severe snakebite, they need to go to the nearest health facility as soon as possible. Antivenom is more effective if it's given as soon after the bite as possible.\n\nI think the health system challenges are going to be considerable in terms of getting antivenoms to the right place, with appropriately trained staff at smaller centers closer to rural areas. The reality is that countries find the antivenom bills quite substantial.\n\nAll these efforts will cost money. Are you concerned about funding this lesser-known problem in the current climate of shrinking funds for global health?\n\nWell, the short answer is yes. It's probably the most difficult time for global health funding in the last 20 years. We need to look for different sources of funding and also need to look at how we can integrate this [snakebite initiative] with the other initiatives, like efforts to have community health workers deliver more primary care.\n\nWith a little bit of initiative and a bit of funding, we can make a big difference.\n\nPostscript: The snake sculptures were taken down after the World Health Assembly ended this week.

Choosing a later evening or early morning time for a run in one smart way to stay safe.\n\nTreadmill fatigue is real. That's why when the weather warms up many indoor exercisers are outside faster than you can say manual or hills program.\n\nBut this summer, as climate change continues to push Earth's weather to extremes, entire swaths of the U.S. have experienced record-breaking levels of heat.\n\nSo, what's an exerciser who can't face heading back indoors to do? Yeah, yeah, get up earlier to beat the heat — thanks for the advice, early birds. But let's get real: For some of us, that just isn't going to happen. Work, kids, and our desperate cling to sleep — all get in the way.\n\nSo, is a daytime run or bike ride in hot summer weather OK for our bodies? Or are we risking heat exhaustion or — even worse — heat stroke (there's a big difference, as we'll get into further down).\n\nThe short answer is yes, it can be ok to exercise when it's hot if you take precautions. But you have to tread (or hike or jog) carefully. And keep an eye on local heat advisories — it's best to shift your workout indoors in air conditioning during extreme temperatures.\n\nShots - Health News \n8 mistakes to avoid if you're going out in the heat\n\nShots - Health News \n8 mistakes to avoid if you're going out in the heat\n\nShots - Health News \n8 mistakes to avoid if you're going out in the heat\n\nWe asked two specialists in heat and exercise — Carol Ewing Garber, professor of movement science at Columbia University and Dr. Matt Leonard, attending emergency physician at Suburban Hospital, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (both regular exercisers) — to discuss the science behind exercising in the heat, how to keep your body safe, and what to do if you suspect you or someone you're with has heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\nWait, what? Doesn't our body need fuel to move? Yes, that's true, say Garber. A light meal is a great idea — just put an hour between eating and your workout in the heat. \"It takes blood and energy to your gut to digest the food and that makes more body heat — not what you want when you're already hot,\" she explains.\n\nIf you had a heavy meal like a cheeseburger, she says, you'll want to wait two to three hours before your hot outdoor exercise, since that fat- and protein-rich meal will take even longer to move through the digestive process.\n\nSo should you eat after that hot run? No, Garber advises. Hydrate right away, but wait until you've cooled off to eat, since digesting food will delay getting your body back to its usual temperature.\n\nShots - Health News \nHearts Get 'Younger,' Even At Middle Age, With Exercise\n\nShots - Health News \nHearts Get 'Younger,' Even At Middle Age, With Exercise\n\nShots - Health News \nHearts Get 'Younger,' Even At Middle Age, With Exercise\n\nThe skin is an \"amazing self-cooling apparatus,\" says Leonard. \"Your skin and subcutaneous tissues are incredibly designed to move warm blood away from your core to keep your vital organs cool.

And consider wearing loose, lightweight clothing that blocks the sun, and include a hat. \"The head has a large body surface area for cooling, and a hat provides shade so that area stays cool,\" he says.\n\nThe other reason to protect your skin is to avoid cancer, Leonard adds. \"That's a great longer-term benefit.\"\n\nThe type of protective clothing you wear can also help you stay cool, says Leonard. \"Wear sweat-wicking athletic clothing that allows your skin to perspire and cool,\" he says, \"and avoid materials like cotton that basically keep the heat close to your body.\"\n\nUseful clothes needn't be fancy; inexpensive sportswear designed to wick sweat from your skin can be found at most major retailers.\n\nGarber agrees that breathable clothing is important in hot weather, but says exposing more skin (as long as you also wear sunscreen, and avoid the brightest hours of the day) can be helpful, too. \"Exercise clothes have gotten smaller and smaller,\" Garber says with a laugh, \"which is actually good for high temperatures because the more skin you have exposed to the atmosphere the easier it is for sweat to evaporate.\"\n\nDehydration can really sneak up on you, says Garber. The best defense against dehydration is a good offense. \"Make sure you are drinking water at least an hour before you head out to exercise,\" she says, adding to keep drinking while you're working out (Leonard says it's important to start getting hydrated even the night before).\n\nGarber recommends replenishing what's lost during your workout by drinking somewhere between a half liter to a liter for every hour you're exercising in the heat.\n\nAnd what should you be drinking? \"If you're working out for an hour or less, nice cold water is the best choice because it is absorbed pretty quickly. If you're going to be at it longer than that, then consider a sports drink to replenish sodium and electrolytes.\"\n\nHow do you know if you're dehydrated? \"Check the color of your urine,\" says Leonard. \"That's the best gauge for internal status.\" Leonard says your pee should be close to clear and not deeply yellow or brown. He says to also take note how often you have to pee. Haven't had to go in a bit? That may be a sign you're dehydrated.\n\nLeonard also warns about going overboard on the water which can lead to a condition called hyponatremia. \"You see this in athletic events where competitors are excessively hydrating with electrolyte deficient sources like water, and that can lead to seizures, cardiovascular collapse and brain swelling.\"\n\nShots - Health News \nGet Off The Couch Baby Boomers, Or You May Not Be Able To Later\n\nShots - Health News \nGet Off The Couch Baby Boomers, Or You May Not Be Able To Later\n\nShots - Health News \nGet Off The Couch Baby Boomers, Or You May Not Be Able To Later\n\nGarber says that while she loves hiking and running, when it gets hot, she opts for sports that her body can handle a bit easier in the heat. \"If the water is cool, swimming is a great choice on hot days and a good way to manage heat in general, because your body is stressed from heat even if you're not exercising.\"\n\nYoga is also a good alternative, she says, because it is really beneficial from a fitness standpoint but doesn't take quite as much energy as running or riding your bike.\n\nBoth Leonard and Garber say that one of the simplest ways to keep your body temperature at a reasonable level when you're exercising on a hot summer day is to go out earlier in the morning than you might in other seasons, or later in the evening, when the air temperature is cooler.\n\n\"That midday sun can add as much as 20 degrees or more to the actual air temperature,\" says Garber. \"You really have to be careful about that.\"\n\nIf you're set on that noon run, at least consider moving your normal run in the sun to a shadier route where you can stay cooler easier, says Garber.\n\nA dry heat is easier on your body, says Garber. \"Your sweat is able to evaporate in a dry heat, and you are better able to keep your body temperature in that normal, healthy range.\"\n\nBut high outside temperatures in a dry climate can also be dangerous. \"Because your sweat is evaporating so quickly (and you don't have a soaked shirt) you often won't realize how much water your body has used,\" Garber says. \"You don't have that cue and can become dehydrated.\"\n\nIn humid areas, it's easier to tell how much water you're using because you're probably sweating at least some — but high humidity carries its own risks. \"It's harder in humid areas for your sweat to evaporate and that really impairs your body's ability to cool yourself off,\" she says. \"If you're soaked in sweat, think of that as a reminder to your body that it is not able to cool itself as well and to be careful.\"\n\nGarber also says you need to be aware of the relative heat your body is exposed to, and not just what the thermometer says the outside temperature is — especially in humid areas. Meteorologists rely on a special thermometer called a wet bulb to measure the temperature in relationship to the humidity. Before you head out when it's hot, always check the humidity, as well as the temperature, Garber says. \"If it is humid out, then the real temperature stress on your body is much greater.\"\n\nWhen you exercise even in perfect conditions, there's a lot of competition among different body parts for oxygenated blood, says Garber.\n\n\"Your body is trying to send blood to your heart to keep it moving and to your skin to cool you down and to the area of the body you're exercising,\" she explains. \"And you only have about five liters of blood, so it can really put a stress on your cardiovascular system. That's on a good day.\"\n\nShots - Health News \nCould Exercising In Frigid Temperatures Make Us Healthier?\n\nShots - Health News \nCould Exercising In Frigid Temperatures Make Us Healthier?\n\nShots - Health News \nCould Exercising In Frigid Temperatures Make Us Healthier?\n\nAdding high heat to that mix puts a whole other layer of stress on your body, Garber says, so please slow down if you need to.\n\n\"It's perfectly fine to back off a bit when you're trying to exercise in that heat,\" she says, \"and particularly important if you have heart disease, diabetes, or any chronic disease. It really puts so much strain on your heart that it could make something terrible happen — like a heart attack.\"\n\nAlong with those with preexisting conditions, children, and the elderly — particularly if they're not regularly active — need to be especially careful when exercising in heat, both Garber and Leonard emphasize, because their ability to regulate their body temperature is less efficient.\n\nThe warning signs of heat exhaustion include fatigue, extreme thirst, nausea, headache, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, muscle cramping and just a general sense of lightheadedness.\n\nThe warning signs for heatstroke (a much more serious emergency, Leonard notes) include all the above but also confusion, vomiting, seizures, cardiovascular collapse or passing out and a lack of sweating.\n\nWeather \nThe West Coast Heat Has Killed Dozens And Hospitalized More In Canada And The U.S.\n\nWeather \nThe West Coast Heat Has Killed Dozens And Hospitalized More In Canada And The U.S.\n\nWeather \nThe West Coast Heat Has Killed Dozens And Hospitalized More In Canada And The U.S.\n\nThe first step to help anyone who exhibits symptoms of heat exhaustion or heatstroke is to get them to immediately stop what they are doing, Leonard says. Remove the soccer player from the field, tell the hiker to sit down, get the tennis player out of the sun.\n\nIf symptoms point to heatstroke (especially anything neurological like confusion), they need to be taken to an emergency facility right away, he says.\n\nFor heat exhaustion, Leonard says to take steps immediately to adequately cool the person who's overheated: Mist them with a spray bottle, for example, or pour water over their head. The most important places to cool are the head and face, the arm pits, and the groin, he says. \"These are all areas of high blood flow and, when cooled, the blood near the surface is transported back toward the core of the body and sent to the vital organs.\"\n\nOften a workout in the heat at the beginning of summer is more difficult than in the middle because your body hasn't adapted to the heat yet, says Garber. It will adapt to higher temperatures over time, she says.

Much of the Midwest, Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions are baking this week.\n\nThis year is predicted to be one of the hottest on record. And heat can be deadly. Last year the U.S. saw an estimated 2,300 heat-related deaths, according to the AP.\n\nIf you're in a place with a heat advisory, you should try to stay indoors as much as you can. But if you need to go outside, or if you're somewhere with more moderate heat, remember to take precautions.\n\nIt might be OK to mow the lawn or go to a cookout, but \"don't overdo it,\" warns John Schumann, a primary care physician in Tulsa, Okla. \"Heat can envelop and pummel you.\"\n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about the best ways to stay safe, notes David Eisenman, a physician at UCLA who is co-director of the UCLA Center for Healthy Climate Solutions. Here are mistakes to avoid and ways to plan ahead to protect yourself from the heat.\n\nWhen a heat wave strikes, your body needs time to adjust, says Neil Gandhi, a physician at Houston Methodist Hospital: \"You can't do too much too soon.\"\n\nIf you go from mostly spending time in air conditioning to an outdoor activity in the sweltering heat, you could be caught off guard. Your body isn't \"acclimatized to handle the stress,\" Gandhi says. And every year, about 650 people die from heat-related illness in the United States.\n\nFortunately, once acclimatized, the body gets better at fending off heat-related illness. \"Our body starts to sweat sooner at a lower body temperature and at a greater rate,\" explains Eisenman. Also, blood flow to the skin improves, which has the effect of cooling us down by carrying heat out of the body's core. And your thirst increases, so you're less likely to get dehydrated.\n\nBut this doesn't happen immediately. \"It's going to happen over the space of several days of exposure,\" Eisenman says. So if you're planning a hiking trip, summer sightseeing or any other extended exposure to heat, plan to spend short periods in the heat each day in the days leading up to your outdoor adventure.\n\nAnd note that kids acclimatize much more slowly than adults, says Eisenman, so give them extra days to prepare.\n\nHydrate in advance, says Wafi Momin, a cardiologist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Katy, Texas. \"Grab a glass of water or a sports drink before you head out to the outdoors,\" he says.\n\nAnd bring plenty of water with you, and don't wait until you're thirsty to start drinking during an outdoor activity. \"The moment you begin to feel thirsty, you're likely anywhere between 10 to 25% dehydrated already,\" says Gandhi.\n\nMost people aren't even hydrated enough on a normal day, Eisenman notes, so it's easy to start at a deficit on a hot day. His advice is to double the amount you'd drink in a typical day. The best test of hydration is to check the color of your urine. \"Make sure that you're peeing frequently and that your urine is pale\" — almost clear, says Eisenman.\n\nWater is the best way to hydrate — and it's free! Sports drinks add electrolytes and can be helpful if you've gotten overheated or if you're participating in a marathon or other endurance event — but they're not necessary when you're simply trying to stay hydrated throughout the day, says Schumann, who also serves as a medical director for Oak Street Health, a chain of primary care clinics. In Tulsa, he says, in recent weeks they've seen bouts of 100-degree weather.\n\n\"In these heat-dome times, though I pooh-pooh all the millennials who carry water bottles everywhere, the kids — they're right about this,\" he says.\n\nYou may not realize how hot it's getting inside your car.\n\nCars heat up so fast even in moderate heat because of a \"mini greenhouse effect,\" Eisenman explains.\n\n\"The sun is coming through those windows, and then the heat is getting bounced around and getting trapped inside. It turns into a different wavelength of heat and doesn't go back out the windows,\" he says. \"And on a day of moderate temperatures, say like 75 degrees outside, in 25 minutes it will become 100 degrees inside your car.\"\n\nEach year, about 50 children die when left in a car. So do not underestimate the dangers, especially if you're distracted by finishing up a phone call, says Eisenman. \"Even with the air conditioner running, even with the windows cracked, it can become hot in there very quickly,\" he adds.\n\nCertain medications can make people more vulnerable to heat, explains Momin.\n\nSome heart medications such as blood pressure drugs, which millions of people take, are diuretic, he explains. \"Those medications are trying to get rid of fluid from your body because of underlying heart issues,\" he says. And if you then add heat, which also causes you to lose excessive amounts of fluid, \"that can cause a very dangerous situation.\"\n\nOther types of medications can have this effect too, says Schumann. These include anticholinergic medications, anticonvulsants, bladder medications and sedatives. \"Lots of medicines work by dehydrating us — excreting excess fluid. Be careful!\" he warns.\n\nIn general, older people are more vulnerable to heat, so if you're older and on these medications, take extra precautions to stay cool and hydrated. Ask your doctor whether any of your medicines could be dehydrating.\n\nThe first few signs that you're getting overheated may not feel too alarming: sweating, fatigue, dizziness and headache. You might feel nauseous or lightheaded. But \"those are the telltale signs of heat exhaustion creeping in,\" says Momin.\n\n\"You may just blow it off, saying, you know, it's hot and I've felt this way before, but the worst of the symptoms can come on very quickly without realizing it,\" he says. \"And all of a sudden, your body's overheating to a point where you won't really be able to drink enough fluids at that juncture to reverse what's already gone on.\"\n\nSymptoms of heat exhaustion can quickly become more serious. They can include muscle cramping, increased fatigue and accelerated heart rate. \"You may start to weaken and just kind of get out of breath as you exert yourself,\" Gandhi says.\n\nIf you're with someone who begins to show signs of heat-related illness, move the person to a cool place, give them water or a sports drink and moisten their skin. You can also remove unnecessary clothing such as shoes, socks and jackets.\n\nThen, observe them. Their symptoms should start to improve in about 30 minutes, Eisenman says. If they don't get better in that time or if at any point they start having more worrisome symptoms, call for medical help. \"I think sometimes people wait too long to call 911,\" says Eisenman.\n\n\"If their heart rate is going fast, if they're breathing quickly, if they seem at all confused, those are all indicators they've had more exposure to the heat than you can handle,\" Eisenman says.\n\nWhen heatstroke sets in, people can even lose consciousness or pass out — in this case, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nYou really want to avoid heatstroke: With heatstroke, your core body temperature can rise quickly to 103 to 105 degrees or more, says Gandhi. When this happens, \"you can start to experience some organ damage pretty quickly.\"\n\nIf you're spending time in the heat, what you wear matters. \"I would seek lighter colors because those tend to reflect heat rather than absorb heat compared to darker colors such as blacks and dark blues,\" says Momin. And stay away from tight clothing, which can block airflow.\n\n\"Loose-fitting clothing allows for the heat to evaporate off your body more easily,\" adds Eisenman.\n\nIf you're at an outdoor party, resist that ice-cold margarita. Go for mocktails instead. \"Alcohol will dehydrate you much faster\" in the heat, says Schumann.\n\nIf you're determined to have something with a little kick in it, \"drink some water for every drink you have to avoid trouble,\" he says. \"If you wind up having to pee a lot, it'll be worth it. If you don't, you might be getting into trouble.\"\n\n\"Alcohol is very problematic\" if you're outdoors in the heat, agrees Momin. Not only does it cause you to lose fluids, but \"it can also impair your judgment.\" And when that happens, you might miss the signs of heat-related illness.\n\nThis story was originally published on July 12, 2023.",

Her signoff allowed plants to put red-white-and-blue \"USDA inspected\" stickers on grocery-store packages.\n\nLast month, Soldner took the Trump administration up on its offer of early retirement, joining an exodus from the Food Safety and Inspection Service that began under President Biden's reorganization of the agency last year. Soldner, who also chairs the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, says remaining inspectors must now visit eight facilities — double the usual number — each day.\n\nFood \nUSDA report finds Boar's Head listeria outbreak was due to poor sanitation practices\n\nFood \nUSDA report finds Boar's Head listeria outbreak was due to poor sanitation practices\n\nFood \nUSDA report finds Boar's Head listeria outbreak was due to poor sanitation practices\n\nThat's not possible, she says, so it's unclear how much food is legitimately earning that stamp of approval.\n\n\"Did that plant receive that daily inspection from inspection personnel? In my mind, that's a huge question mark,\" Soldner says.\n\nShe says further staff retirements, hostility toward federal workers, and plummeting morale are creating conditions that make consumers more vulnerable to outbreaks of foodborne illness, like the deadly listeria contamination that hit Boar's Head deli meats last year, killing 10 people and hospitalizing dozens.\n\n\"Do I foresee another Boar's Head situation? Absolutely,\" she says. \"I worry about the public.\"\n\nExperts who study the nation's food supply say the safety of everything we eat — from milk and macaroni to meat and lettuce — is called into question because of massive cuts by the Trump administration to the three federal agencies charged with monitoring it: the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThose three agencies coordinate and fund a lot of the complex work that makes up the country's food safety surveillance system, while state and local regulators and inspectors conduct a lot of work on the ground.\n\nFood \nYes, the number of food recalls has been rising. Here's what you need to know\n\nFood \nYes, the number of food recalls has been rising. Here's what you need to know\n\nFood \nYes, the number of food recalls has been rising. Here's what you need to know\n\nMost produce is inspected by states, for example, though select samples are sent to one of the FDA's national labs to test for pathogens like salmonella or E.coli. When a consumer falls ill, it's often the local health officials who are first to know and then report cases to the CDC, which in turn traces the contamination to its sources and compiles data.\n\n\"Our federal food safety system is teetering on the brink of a collapse,\" says Sarah Sorscher, a policy expert at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She's most concerned about the loss of expertise from recent job cuts.\n\nBut she also worries about policy moves like the administration's rollback of new USDA food-safety rules set last August that would have limited the amount of salmonella in poultry in order for it to be sold. Instead, the agency said it is reevaluating the issue and whether salmonella regulations need updating at all.\n\nIn statements emailed to NPR, FDA and USDA said recent streamlining of their operations will not alter their commitment to food safety. USDA announced Tuesday that it boosted funds to reimburse states for food safety inspections by $14.5 million.\n\nIn a separate emailed statement, the USDA called its inspectors' work \"critical,\" and said therefore inspectors were exempt from its hiring freeze, and its \"front-line inspectors and veterinarians were not offered the opportunity to participate\" in the agency's second early retirement offer in April \"because of the essential nature of their work.\"\n\nHowever, NPR reviewed emails sent from USDA officials urging inspectors to take the early retirement deal and confirming their eligibility for it, as well as a document listing eligible job categories, including consumer safety inspector and slaughterhouses inspectors.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration also abruptly shuttered two of the FDA's seven food testing labs in San Francisco and Chicago, according to several FDA staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nThe ensuing chaos delayed seafood inspections and routine produce testing, the FDA staffers, including microbiologists working in different labs, told NPR. Samples of lettuce or fruit had to be shipped in ice-packed containers to redirect them to other labs, where a shortage of staff and basic lab supplies such as plastic pipettes and other testing supplies, makes it difficult to triage the workload.\n\nThis month, the administration reopened the two labs, but Sorscher, who leads regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says damage has been done. \"It's as if you took a chainsaw and started cutting holes out of the walls of a house,\" she says. \"You can't really point to the fact that the doors or windows are still there and say, 'Don't worry, the house is secure.'\"\n\nThe CDC said in an emailed statement that its lab, surveillance and data collection work continues and that the agency \"remains prepared to respond to, and work with states on those outbreaks.\"\n\nBut many of the state and local food-safety programs historically funded by the CDC are at risk, says Steven Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials. Budgets and staffing have been cut at CDC, which affects how it supports local programs. The CDC, for example, typically funded staff to notify the public in the event of outbreaks, or to help remove dangerous products from shelves, as they did with lead-contaminated apple sauce pouches in 2023.\n\nMandernach says many states can no longer afford staff dedicated to public communications. So he worries about delayed warnings and less robust local tracking of cases that would affect national data.\n\n\"It could artificially make it look like, 'Hey, food safety is great here,' when the reality is we're not looking for it as much,\" he says.",

By dawn, they're ready with their most popular offering: a thousand pieces of pav, which flies off the shelves as soon as the bakery opens.\n\nPav is a soft and fluffy bread, with a crusty top and a distinct smoky flavor. It resembles a Parker House roll except there is no egg in the pav's dough. The word originates from the Portuguese word for bread — pao. It arrived in India with Portuguese traders who sailed into nearby harbors more than 600 years ago and brought with them a taste of home.\n\nIt became a street food fixture in the 19th century, when the port city was emerging as a textile hub, drawing workers from nearby towns and villages to its cotton spinning and weaving factories.\n\n\"Pav is what Bombay's working-class blue-collar workers were eating, especially those who were far from home without the infrastructure to create Indian food for them,\" says Mumbai-based food anthropologist Kurush Dalal, referring to the city by its former name.\n\nA baker in Mumbai weighs dough that will become the beloved pav bread.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Indranil Aditya for NPR\n\nA baker in Mumbai weighs dough that will become the beloved pav bread.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Indranil Aditya for NPR\n\nA baker in Mumbai weighs dough that will become the beloved pav bread.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nA baker in Mumbai weighs dough that will become the beloved pav bread.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nA baker in Mumbai weighs dough that will become the beloved pav bread.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nSince then, Mumbai's population has grown ten times over the past century to 12 million. This teeming port city is home to Bollywood, stock markets, billionaire industrialists and millions of migrants, of collars blue and white, living in slums and skyscrapers. Mumbai's textile factories today are hulking shells of their past, overgrown by wild fig trees.\n\nBut pav remains a working class staple. A stack of six — called a ladi — costs less than 25 cents.\n\nGoats and Soda \nThyme for some healing soup recipes from around the world\n\nGoats and Soda \nThyme for some healing soup recipes from around the world\n\nGoats and Soda \nThyme for some healing soup recipes from around the world\n\nBut now, pav's survival is in peril.\n\nIn February , the government announced that it would ban wood-fired bakeries across the city in the next six months. The order came a few months after the Mumbai-based Bombay Environmental Action Group published a study claiming that over the course of a year, pollution from Mumbai's 1,000-odd wood-fired bakeries was as harmful to each resident as smoking 400 cigarettes.\n\nBut critics say this is a case of misplaced priorities — of picking on the little guy. \"The pollution that is emitted from these bakeries is nothing compared to the pollution that construction sites are contributing or the road repair sites are contributing,\" says former town council representative Makarand Narwekar.\n\nBakers at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai knead trays of dough.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Indranil Aditya for NPR\n\nBakers at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai knead trays of dough.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Indranil Aditya for NPR\n\nBakers at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai knead trays of dough.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nBakers at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai knead trays of dough.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nBakers at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai knead trays of dough.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nHe points to the massive makeover being undertaken by Mumbai's civic body to remake the city's roads, which has only worsened dust and traffic. A study by the Indian climate-tech group Respirer Living Sciences found Mumbai's air was unsafe for nearly half of 2024.\n\nRavi Andhale, chief of the pollution control board, acknowledges that wood-fired bakeries aren't the worst offenders in Mumbai. According to the Bombay Environmental Action Group study they only contribute 3% of the city's particulate matter pollution – referring to matter in the air smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter). But \"just because your share is little — you should not do anything — is not acceptable,\" he says.\n\nAnd the lead author of the study which spotlighted how polluting wood-fired bakeries are says one reason why they're being targeted is that it's just easier to solve that little slice of the problem.\n\n\"As far as the pollution from construction, infrastructure and vehicles go, they have a lot of complexities,\" says Hema Ramani, an environmental consultant who works on legal and policy issues. \"That's why we said let's look at faster, quicker, smaller transitions that can happen. Then you move on to the bigger ones.\"\n\nRamani says she doesn't want the bakeries to shut shop, only switch to a cleaner fuel like natural gas or electricity. The government can help, she says, by subsidizing the equipment or transition costs.\n\nBut Nasir Ansari, president of the Bombay Bakers Association, says that would increase the cost of the pav by more than a half. \"Pav is often the food of the working-class. Even a small price rise makes a huge difference. A few months ago, we had raised the price of a stack of six by three rupees\" — a couple of pennies. \"We still had customers asking me why I did that.\"\n\nA baker places dough into a wood-fired stove at Yazdani Bakery.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Indranil Aditya for NPR\n\nA baker places dough into a wood-fired stove at Yazdani Bakery.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Indranil Aditya for NPR\n\nA baker places dough into a wood-fired stove at Yazdani Bakery.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nA baker places dough into a wood-fired stove at Yazdani Bakery.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nA baker places dough into a wood-fired stove at Yazdani Bakery.\n                \n                    \n                    Indranil Aditya for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nIt's not just about the cost, pav bakers say.

He points to his own family history: Zend's ancestors came from Iran more than hundred years ago — and set up Mumbai's most iconic Iranian restaurants and bakeries — where their key product is a Portuguese-origin bread. It's been a great business for the family. He taps his potbelly to demonstrate.\n\n\"I definitely want clean air in Bombay,\" says Zend. \"But I don't want to be the smallest and the easiest target.\"\n\nAnd he thinks the method of baking is the key to success. \"You can't beat the wood-fire,\" he says. \"In America, you smoke the chops and that smokiness is everything. It's like that with pav too.\" Those made in electric ovens, he says, \"taste like cardboard.\"",

But a few locals resent what they consider the elitist scientists at the facility, which has employed about 500 people in recent years. Or they fear the contagious pathogens studied there could escape the labs' well-protected walls.\n\nEducation \nWhat National Institutes of Health funding cuts could mean for U.S. universities\n\nEducation \nWhat National Institutes of Health funding cuts could mean for U.S. universities\n\nEducation \nWhat National Institutes of Health funding cuts could mean for U.S. universities\n\nThat split widened with the COVID-19 pandemic and the divisions that emerged from mask mandates and vaccine development. In 2023, Matt Rosendale, a Republican who was then a U.S. representative from Montana, falsely tied the lab to the origins of COVID in an attempt to cut its funding.\n\nNow, Hamilton is a prime example of how the Trump administration's mass federal layoffs and cancellation of research grants are being felt in communities far from Washington, D.C.\n\nSome residents of Hamilton, Mont., in April protest efforts to restructure the nation's government.

Others flipped off the rallygoers and cast insults at them. A passing bicyclist taunted protestors with chants of \"DOGE\" — short for the Department of Government Efficiency, the federal initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk to cut costs that has driven mass layoffs and slashed programs.\n\nKim Hasenkrug, a former Rocky Mountain Labs researcher of 31 years, who retired in 2022, joined the crowd. He slammed President Donald Trump's promise to let Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"go wild\" on health issues.\n\n\"We're beginning to see what 'going wild' looks like,\" Hasenkrug said. \"These cuts will not streamline research. They will throttle it.\"\n\nAs of early May, 41 Rocky Mountain Labs workers had been let go or told their contracts would end this summer, and nine more had retired early, according to researchers employed by the facility.\n\nKFF Health News spoke with 10 current or former Rocky Mountain Labs workers who requested anonymity to speak about information that has not been publicly released. The federal government has also slashed billions of dollars for research, including at least $29 million in grants to Montana recipients, ranging from university scientists to the state health department. That's according to HHS data confirmed by KFF Health News.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont.\n                \n                    \n                    Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont.\n                \n                    \n                    Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont.\n                \n                    \n                    Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont.\n                \n                    \n                    Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThe National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont.\n                \n                    \n                    Katheryn Houghton/KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nScientists who remain in Hamilton said research has slowed. They've struggled to buy basic gear amid federal directives that changed how orders are placed. Now, more cuts are planned for workers who buy and deliver critical, niche supplies, such as antibodies, according to researchers at the labs.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to repeated requests for more information on the government's cuts to research, including questions about the changes in Hamilton. Emily Hilliard, a deputy press secretary, said the department is committed to the \"continuity of essential research.\"\n\nSome within the lab feel like they've become public enemies or outcasts, unable to defend themselves without risking their jobs. Postdoctoral scientists just starting their careers are seeing options dwindle. Some workers whose employment contracts expire within days or weeks have been in the dark about whether they'll be renewed. At least one Rocky Mountain Labs scientist moved to another country to research infectious disease, citing \"current turmoil,\" according to an email sent from the scientist to co-workers that was reviewed by KFF Health News.\n\n\"The remaining staff has been discredited, disrespected, and discouraged from remaining in public service,\" Hasenkrug said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world. It has 27 institutes and centers focused on understanding illness and disabilities and improving health. The agency's research has contributed to the development of vaccines against major diseases — from smallpox to COVID — and has been behind the majority of medicines approved for the U.S. market. That research also generated more than $94.5 billion in new economic activity nationwide, according to United for Medical Research, a coalition of research groups and advocates.\n\nThe Trump administration aims to eliminate at least 1,200 jobs at the NIH and shrink its budget by 40%. The administration's budget proposal to cut NIH funding calls the agency's spending \"wasteful,\" deems its research \"risky,\" and accuses it of promoting \"dangerous ideologies.\"\n\nIt's a dramatic political turnabout for the NIH, which for decades enjoyed bipartisan support in Washington. From 2015 to 2023, its annual budget grew by more than $17 billion.\n\nAs of 2023, Rocky Mountain Labs was one of only 51 facilities in the world with the highest level of biosafety precautions, according to the Global BioLabs mapping project. In April, HHS indefinitely stalled work at another of those labs, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland, Wired reported.\n\nKennedy has said the nation should pause funding infectious disease research, and the White House has said it plans to intensify scrutiny of gain-of-function research, which involves altering a pathogen to study its spread.\n\nHamilton, in Ravalli County, is home to scientists, ranchers, and outdoor recreationists. Here, 1 in 8 people live below the federal poverty line. Nearly 70% of county residents who participated in the 2024 presidential election voted for Trump, and Trump signs still dot U.S. Highway 93 leading to town. In the thick of the COVID pandemic, the sheriff and county commissioners refused to enforce a statewide mandate to mask in public spaces while Rocky Mountain Labs researchers worked to understand the virus.\n\nThe lab's work dates to 1900, and even early on it was controversial. Rocky Mountain spotted fever was killing people in the valley. Researchers found the cause — ticks — and worked to eradicate the disease-carrying bugs by requiring ranchers to treat their cattle.\n\nThat created resentment among locals who \"already harbored a healthy distrust of government-imposed programs,\" according to an NIH history. The tension came to a head in 1913 when a \"dipping vat\" used to chemically treat cattle was blown up with dynamite and another damaged with sledgehammers.\n\nNow, some residents and local leaders are worried about the economic consequences of an exodus of federal workers and their salaries. Most of the county is government-managed public land, and the first wave of federal cuts hit U.S. Forest Service workers who do everything from clear trails to fight wildfires.\n\nRocky Mountain Labs creates more work for industries including construction and brings more people into the city's shops, a 2023 University of Montana study found. The rural community is also a base for international vaccine developer GSK due to the lab's presence. Kathleen Quinn, a vice president of communications for the company, said GSK's business with government agencies \"continues as usual\" for now amid federal changes and that it's \"too early to say what any longer-term impact could be.\"\n\nHamilton city leaders moved a weeknight March meeting on federal cuts to a school auditorium to fit a crowd of people concerned that Trump's reshuffling would change the nature of their town.

Because of the layoffs, they can't afford to live here,\" he said. \"Some people retire here but that's not everyone.\"\n\nJane Shigley said she's been a Hamilton resident for more than 30 years and initially thought the government would find \"some inefficiencies, no big deal.\" But now she's worried about her hometown's future.\n\n\"Something's going on that we can't control,\" Shigley said. \"And the people that it's happening to aren't allowed to talk to us about it.\"\n\nThe City Council sent a letter to federal officials in April asking for formal consultation prior to any significant changes, given Hamilton's \"interdependence\" with Rocky Mountain Labs and the federally controlled lands surrounding Hamilton. As of May, city leaders hadn't received a response.\n\nPeople in town are split on how badly the federal cuts will affect Hamilton.\n\nJulie Foster, executive director of the Ravalli County Economic Development Authority, said the community survived the decline of logging, and she thinks Rocky Mountain Labs will survive, too.\n\n\"It will be here. There may be bumps in the road, but this is a resilient place,\" Foster said.\n\nEven amid the cuts at Rocky Mountain Labs, researchers' work continues. This spring, scientists there helped make the first identification in Montana of a species of tick known to carry Lyme disease.\n\nKFF Health News correspondent Rae Ellen Bichell contributed to this report.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF.",

Kennedy Jr.'s overhaul of the nation's health agencies.\n\n\"We survey about 70,000 people, 12 and older each year,\" says Jennifer Hoenig, who used to lead the team of scientists in charge of the survey, which is the largest in the country\n\nOn April 1, Hoenig and her 16-person team of mostly statisticians lost their jobs to the layoffs orchestrated by Elon Musk's DOGE effort to shrink the federal government. The Department of Health and Human Services fired 10,000 staff, while another 10,000 employees took buyouts and early retirement offers.\n\nIn a statement to NPR, Emily Hilliard, press secretary at HHS, wrote that agency staff are working with a contractor to continue conducting the 2025 survey. And the 2024 annual report will be out later this summer. Since the firings, the agency has published two brief reports based on the 2023 survey – one on use of marijuana by people 12 years and older and one about the treatments received by adults with serious mental illness.\n\nHoenig and her colleagues analyzed the survey data each year and put out detailed reports on the prevalence of mental health problems and substance use.\n\n\"It is really the first line for people to understand the prevalence of substance use, substance use disorders and mental health outcomes, treatment, recovery and things like that,\" Hoenig says.\n\nIn addition to a report on national estimates, Hoenig says her team also put out \"state and substate\" estimates. \"It allows people to really figure out 'who are the people in the country that need help, who are these people? Where do they live? What are their issues?'\"\n\n\"Those of us who work in the field and also a lot of states, they know it's one of the major tools for assessing behavioral health in America,\" says Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn a recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics, McCabe and his colleagues used the data from the survey and estimated that 1 in 4 kids in the United States has a parent with a substance use disorder.\n\nHe says this data is critical for researchers like himself as well as lawmakers and health care care providers. \"Addressing addiction and promoting recovery are national priorities, and it's really difficult to monitor progress without one of America's gold standard metrics.\"\n\nThe same goes for efforts to address mental health problems, says Katherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who has also used the NSDUH data for years for her research.\n\n\"Unless we know how many people are affected by common mental health problems, it will really hamper our efforts to determine whether the interventions that we're trying to implement are having any kind of effect,\" says Keyes.\n\n\"This is really a central piece of data,\" says Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"When we use it clinically, it's often in a way that is helping pediatricians like me and my colleagues across the country understand what's going on with teenagers.\"\n\nFor example, the prevalence of opioid addiction among teens.\n\n\"We know now from the NSDUH that about one in 80 teenagers struggles with opioid addiction,\" says Hadland. \"That's a lot higher than any pediatrician would guess. And we only know that because of this survey.\"\n\nThe data also reflects the success of past efforts to address substance use among young people, says Keyes. \"You look at factors like cigarette and tobacco use among young people, which is at extraordinary lows. Binge drinking and alcohol use has been declining among young people.\"\n\nBut there's still a long way to go, she adds. And \"if some of these trends reverse, we need to know immediately.\"\n\nHilliard says the survey will continue as HHS reorganizes, and Kennedy has indicated that mental health and substance use issues will be managed by a new agency he plans to form called the Administration for a Healthy America.\n\nBut Hoenig says it's unclear how the survey will continue without her team of scientists. Hadland stresses that it's important to have scientists at the helm of the survey.\n\n\"This idea that there's sort of a group of experts overseeing the entire survey and really looking out for its future and the reliability and the validity of the questions in the survey is really critical,\" he says.\n\nAnd it's important that the data gathered by the survey is made available to the public, says Hoenig.\n\n\"If that information is not being disseminated out into the public, we will lose lives,\" she says. \"We will lose lives to overdose. We will lives to suicide. But these are entirely preventable.\"",

But in 2020, COVID arrived in the U.S., shuttering hundreds of research studies. By the time the pandemic subsided, Walsh's Alzheimer's had progressed to the point where he no longer qualified for most studies.\n\nIn late 2024, Karen brought Joe to Dr. Seth Gale, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School who promised to look for a research study Walsh could enter.\n\nBefore long, Gale received a query from a colleague looking for a patient with moderate Alzheimer's disease to take part in a trial. He called the Walshes.\n\nThe research involved a monoclonal antibody called foralumab that was being tested on people with inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis.\n\nForalumab nasal spray, above, is being tested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at Mass General Brigham.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n\nForalumab nasal spray, above, is being tested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at Mass General Brigham.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n\nForalumab nasal spray, above, is being tested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at Mass General Brigham.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nForalumab nasal spray, above, is being tested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at Mass General Brigham.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nForalumab nasal spray, above, is being tested as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease by researchers at Mass General Brigham.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nMS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering around nerve fibers, causing inflammation. And foralumab was producing promising results in MS patients.\n\n\"It induces regulatory cells that go to the brain and shut down inflammation,\" Weiner says.\n\nThose regulatory cells reduce the activity of microglia, the cells that serve as the primary immune system in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nWeiner thought foralumab might help with another condition that causes damaging inflammation in the nervous system.\n\n\"I've always been interested in Alzheimer's disease,\" Weiner says. \"I lost my mother to Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nMost efforts to treat Alzheimer's involve clearing the brain of the disease's hallmarks: sticky amyloid plaques and tangled fibers called tau. But increasingly, researchers are seeking ways to tamp down the inflammation that accompanies those brain changes, especially as the disease progresses.\n\n\"Once people have Alzheimer's, the inflammation is driving the disease more,\" Weiner says.\n\nDr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n\nDr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n\nDr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nDr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nDr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThe approach worked in mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's.\n\nBut in order to treat Walsh, Weiner's team had to get special permission from the Food and Drug Administration through a program called expanded access. The program is for patients who can't get into a clinical trial and have no other treatment options.\n\nWhen the FDA approved foralumab for Walsh, he became the first Alzheimer's patient to get the treatment.\n\nSix months later, the drug has dramatically reduced the inflammation in Walsh's brain. But no drug can restore brain cells that have already been lost.\n\nIt will take a battery of cognitive tests to see if Walsh's memory and thinking have improved with the treatment. Karen Walsh, though, sees some positive signs.\n\nAlthough her husband still struggles to find words, she says, he appears to be more engaged in social activities.\n\n\"A couple of guys come pick him up once a month, you know, and they take him out for lunch,\" she says. \"They sent me a text after saying, 'Wow, Joe is really, really laughing, and very involved.'\"\n\nAfter three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n\nAfter three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n\nAfter three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nAfter three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAfter three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.\n                \n                    \n                    Jodi Hilton/for NPR‎\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nWalsh himself seems happy to stay on the drug.

She says Babagana was a cheerful boy who loved to ride his bike around the neighborhood and at school. Their home sits in the town of Bama in the northeastern corner of Nigeria that has, in the past, been terrorized by Boko Haram, the militant Islamist group.\n\nBabagana had sickle cell disease and, in the middle of the night on Feb. 2, Mohammed noticed her son had a fever. As soon as morning came, she rushed him in a keke — a tricycle taxi common in Nigeria — to the local clinic a little over a mile away where Babagana had received care in the past.\n\nWhen she got there, the security guard told her the clinic was closed.\n\nThe clinic was funded by USAID, or the U.S. Agency for International Development, and was the busiest medical facility in the area, seeing up to 400 patients a day. But, just over a week before Babagana arrived, the Trump administration sent the clinic a stop-work order — part of a massive pause in foreign assistance as U.S. officials reviewed contracts and programs to determine whether they should continue.\n\nMore than 80% of foreign aid contracts were canceled but Babagana's clinic was allowed to resume operations on April 14, after the review was complete and the funding restarted.\n\nBut that was more than two months after Mohammed's visit on that February morning. She remembers standing outside the closed clinic with Babagana. \"I was shocked and became angry,\" she told NPR by phone on May 23. She spoke in Kanuri, a local language in Nigeria. \"Immediately, I prayed for God to intervene.\"\n\nMohammed says Babagana's care at the U.S.-funded clinic had been free and she didn't have money to take him to the local government clinic, which charges for medical care.\n\nBabagana's doctor at the clinic — Edifre Jacob — says he'll never know exactly what happened to the youngster because he did not get medical help before dying, but Jacob feels confident his team could have prevented his death.\n\n\"We are sure we would have done something to save the patient,\" says Jacob. \"We have the facility to manage these patients, and we have results — positive results — from patients we manage with sickle cell [disease].\"\n\nSickle cell disease is a condition where a person's red blood cells are deformed, causing them to break down more quickly than normal and potentially clog blood vessels. The condition is associated with a long list of dangerous complications, but prompt medical care can make a big difference.\n\nEven in places with far more medical resources, quick medical care for sickle cell patients is critical. \"We recommend that if a child has a fever, that they be seen as soon as possible, and often within the hour,\" says Dr. Natasha Archer, director of the sickle cell disease program at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nShe says there are several serious conditions Babagana could have had. One is sepsis — a life-threatening infection that can cause a fever. People with sickle cell disease are vulnerable because their spleens often don't clean blood as well as in a healthy person. With quick access to antibiotics, sepsis can be curable, Archer says.\n\nNPR asked the State Department to comment on Babagana's death and Rubio's congressional testimony. They did not respond in time to meet our deadline for publication. We will update this article with their comment if they do respond.\n\nAt the hearings where Rubio spoke, lawmakers highlighted other individual stories of deaths that they attributed to aid cuts. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said that Pe Kha Lau in Myanmar was unable to get oxygen at a local hospital after the aid cuts and that Evan Anzoo, a 5-year-old in South Sudan, could not get HIV medications previously funded by USAID.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., went a step further, citing work from a team at Boston University that aims to estimate the total human cost of cuts to aid through modeling. Such estimates represent a crucial tool in understanding the possible implications of policy actions.\n\n\"Monitoring mortality in low- and middle-income countries is difficult, the systems are not as robust as we have in the United States,\" says Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease modeler who led the team. Many of the health systems that might have collected such data were funded by the same programs that got cut, she says.\n\nNichols and her team started working within days of the Trump administration's freeze of USAID to project the potential impact on human lives. They started with the assumption that all USAID programs were cut, based on publicly available data at the time. Then they factored in what researchers know about what happens when people and children with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases stop getting treatment.\n\nAll told, the researchers estimate that over 96,000 adults and 200,000 infants and children have already died because of cuts, which began on Jan. 24.\n\n\"It's really important they're doing this,\" says Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. \"Generally speaking, their assumptions are quite reasonable.\"\n\nStill, Nichols is the first to acknowledge that these are very rough estimates.\n\n\"The error bars are huge, because we don't know what gaps are being filled and by whom,\" says Nichols. National governments could be stepping in to make up for the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. aid, or nongovernmental organizations on the ground could be finding other sources of funding. Or some clinics could still be operating with volunteers or with funding from other sources.\n\nTheir estimates are not accounting for some deaths, such as Babagana's, who likely died from causes they didn't include in their analyses. Even with all that uncertainty, Nichols stands by her estimates. \"We can argue about the specifics and the size of the error bars, but we're not talking about dozens of people [dying],\" she says. \"We're talking about tens of thousands of people.\"\n\nRubio is dismissive of their modeling. \"That's false, that's fake,\" the secretary of state said of the numbers cited by Merkley at the hearing. He pointed to the fact that these estimates are based on a total cessation of funding, whereas he said 85% of people who rely on PEPFAR — the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS that funds HIV clinics — were still receiving care.\n\nRubio did not provide further information on the source of the 85% number. The State Department did not respond to multiple requests for clarification.\n\nIt \"seems impossible to me\" that 85% of recipients are still getting care, says John Stover, vice president of Avenir Health, a global health consulting firm. \"USAID was dismantled, and most of that [PEPFAR] money was flowing through USAID, so there's no mechanism for that money to reach the programs that need it,\" he said, and far fewer people to implement those programs.\n\nNichols said she would happily update the model of estimated deaths with more information about what programs are still operational. \"If there are programs that are running, provide a list, then we can update it.\"\n\nMariam Mohammed and her surviving son, Umar.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.\n\nA few years ago, some of us on the NPR Music team stumbled upon a copy of Demi Lovato's 2013 book, Staying Strong: 365 Days A Year. Reading Lovato's heartfelt daily reflections became a workday habit; her transparency and vulnerability made us ardent admirers who wanted nothing but the very best for Demi.\n\nWe made it our mission to get Demi to the Tiny Desk, and though the pandemic had other plans, Lovato's Tiny Desk (home) concert was worth the wait. Recorded on a sunny spring day in her Los Angeles backyard, Lovato begins with a moving rendition of \"Tell Me You Love Me\" from her 2017 record of the same name, accompanied by subtle, sparse keys. She continues her set with the title tracks from her recently-released studio album, Dancing With The Devil...The Art Of Starting Over. On both tracks, Lovato's voice feels stabilizing and grounding; there's a sense of clarity and purpose in its power.\n\nWhen interviewed by NPR's Ailsa Chang back in 2017, Demi Lovato said, \"I think I've lived a lot of life.\" Through both her struggles and successes, Lovato's shown all sides of herself – the confident and unapologetic star, but also the complexities of recovery – inviting us on her journey in a deeply personal way. Her intimate (home) concert feels like a natural extension of that sincerity.",

And at the domestic violence shelter where she volunteers as president of the board, Cox said, staff always look to enroll women and their children if possible.\n\nBut Cox, who is 65, has mixed feelings about Medicaid.\n\n\"It's not that I don't see the need for it. I see the need for it literally on a weekly basis,\" she said. \"I also see a need for revamping it significantly because it's been taken advantage of for so long.\"\n\nIt wasn't hard to find people in Globe like Cox with complicated views about Medicaid.\n\nDebbie Cox, a property manager, says she has tenants who need Medicaid to get medical care, but she also thinks the program needs to be strengthened to prevent abuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n\nDebbie Cox, a property manager, says she has tenants who need Medicaid to get medical care, but she also thinks the program needs to be strengthened to prevent abuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n\nDebbie Cox, a property manager, says she has tenants who need Medicaid to get medical care, but she also thinks the program needs to be strengthened to prevent abuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nDebbie Cox, a property manager, says she has tenants who need Medicaid to get medical care, but she also thinks the program needs to be strengthened to prevent abuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nDebbie Cox, a property manager, says she has tenants who need Medicaid to get medical care, but she also thinks the program needs to be strengthened to prevent abuses.\n                \n                    \n                    Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nGila County, where Globe is located, is a conservative place — almost 70% of voters went for President Trump in November. And concerns about government waste run deep.\n\nLike many rural communities, it's also a place where people have come to value government health insurance. The number of Gila County residents on Medicaid and the related Children's Health Insurance Program has nearly doubled over the past 15 years, according to data from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. Today, almost 4 in 10 residents are on one of the health insurance plans for low- and moderate-income people or those with disabilities.\n\nSo, since House Republicans passed plans to cut roughly $716 billion from Medicaid, the national debate taking place over the program hits close to home for many Globe residents, even as some welcome the prospect of tighter rules and less government spending.\n\nFor Heather Heisler, the stakes are high. Her husband has been on Medicaid for years.\n\n\"We're ranchers, and there's not much money in ranching,\" said Heisler, who gets her own health care from the Indian Health Service. \"Most people think there is, but there isn't.\"\n\nHeisler was selling handicrafts outside the old county jail in Globe on a recent Friday night when the town hosted a downtown street fair with food trucks and live music.\n\nShe said Medicaid was especially helpful after her husband had an accident on the ranch. A forklift tipped over, and he had to have part of his left foot amputated.\n\n\"If anything happens, he's able to go to the doctor,\" she said. \"Go to the emergency room, get medicines.\"\n\nShe shook her head when asked what would happen if he lost the coverage. \"It would be very bad for him,\" she said.\n\nAmong other things, the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" passed by House Republicans would require working-age Medicaid enrollees to prove they are employed or seeking work. The bill, which has advanced to the Senate, would also mandate more paperwork from people to prove they're eligible.\n\nDifficult applications can dissuade many people from enrolling in Medicaid, even if they're eligible, researchers have found. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates more than 10 million people will likely lose Medicaid and CHIP insurance under the House Republican plan.\n\nThat would reverse big gains made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act that has allowed millions of low-income, working-age adults in places like Globe to get health insurance.\n\nNationally, Medicaid and CHIP have expanded dramatically over the past two decades, with enrollment in the programs surging from about 56 million in 2005 to more than 78 million last year, according to federal data.\n\n\"Medicaid has always played an important role,\" said Joan Alker, who runs the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. \"But its role has only grown over the last couple of decades. It really stepped in to address many of the shortcomings in our health care system.\"\n\nThat's particularly true in rural areas, where the share of people with disabilities is higher, residents have lower incomes, and communities are reliant on industries with skimpier health benefits such as agriculture and retail.\n\nIn Globe, former Mayor Fernando Shipley said he's seen this firsthand.\n\n\"A lot of people think, 'Oh, those are the people that aren't working.' Not necessarily,\" said Shipley, who operates a State Farm office across the road from the rusted remains of the Old Dominion copper mine. \"If you're a single parent with two kids and you're making $20 an hour,\" he added, \"you're not making ends meet. You've got to pay rent; you've got to feed those kids.\"\n\nFernando Shipley is the former mayor of Globe, Ariz. He says many of the people who rely on Medicaid are working, and otherwise wouldn't be able to afford health care for their families.\n                \n                    \n                    Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Linda Gross for KFF Health News\n\nFernando Shipley is the former mayor of Globe, Ariz.

And that's OK,\" said pollster Bob Ward. \"And if you take away that health care, people are going to be angry.\"\n\nWard's Washington, D.C., firm, Fabrizio Ward, polls for Trump, among other clients. He also works for a coalition trying to protect Medicaid.\n\nAt the same time, many of the communities where Medicaid has become more vital in recent years remain very conservative politically.\n\nMore than two-thirds of nearly 300 U.S. counties with the biggest growth in Medicaid and CHIP since 2008 backed Trump in the last election, according to a KFF Health News analysis of voting results and enrollment data from Georgetown. Many of these counties are in deep-red states such as Kentucky, Louisiana, and Montana.\n\nVoters in places like these are more likely to be concerned about government waste, polls show. In one recent national survey, 75% of Republicans said they think waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicaid is a major problem.\n\nThe actual scale of that waste is hotly debated, though many analysts believe relatively few enrollees are abusing the program.\n\nMountains of mine tailings, or waste, above the valley where Globe, Ariz., is located.

But it could also save your life.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of 11 people die from drowning per day in the U.S.\n\nAlthough drowning death rates have decreased overall, racial and ethnic disparities persist – among adults, Black and Indigenous Americans have the highest drowning rates. These disparities come from a history of segregation at pools and beaches.\n\nCullen Jones, an Olympic gold medalist swimmer, says those statistics partly inspired him to become a swim safety advocate.\n\nAs a child, he was teased for his interest in swimming. \"As a Black male in the '90s wearing Speedos, growing up in the inner city, I had to learn very early not to pay attention to what other people were thinking.\"\n\nIt's important to improve your swimming skills because it isn't just a sport, says Jones. \"It's also a life skill.\"\n\nLife Kit \nHaving a hobby is good for you. Here's how to find one\n\nLife Kit \nHaving a hobby is good for you. Here's how to find one\n\nLife Kit \nHaving a hobby is good for you. Here's how to find one\n\nEven if you have a life jacket or some other floatation device, knowing how to swim will keep you safer than any device, says Jones. \"There is no substitute. Zero.\"\n\nJones recently spoke with Life Kit host Marielle Segarra and shared some tips on how to start swimming.\n\nBefore becoming an Olympic swimmer, Jones had trouble learning to swim, and at the age of five, he nearly drowned. It took Jones working with several different swim instructors before he felt comfortable in the water.\n\nIf you're having a hard time finding a swim teacher you click with, \"Do not give up because you will find that teacher,\" says Jones.\n\nIf you're an adult looking to learn how to swim, try to find a pool near you.\n\n\"Most pools have lifeguards that will teach you,\" says Jones. Some pools may have lesson programs. \"You can, for some people, get those lessons for low or no cost,\" says Jones.\n\nYou can go to the U.S. Masters Swimming website and search for instructors who specifically teach adults near you.\n\nIf you're learning to swim, you may feel discomfort or even shame about not being a strong swimmer immediately. \"What is important – shame or nearly drowning? I'll overcome shame any day of the week,\" says Jones.\n\nJones says he also wants people to embrace being uncomfortable. It's OK not to be good at something right away. \"I love being uncomfortable because growth happens in being uncomfortable.\"\n\nLife Kit \nLearning a new skill can be hard. Here's how to set yourself up for success\n\nLife Kit \nLearning a new skill can be hard. Here's how to set yourself up for success\n\nLife Kit \nLearning a new skill can be hard. Here's how to set yourself up for success\n\nBecoming a strong swimmer isn't just about holding your breath underwater or splashing around in the pool. According to the American Red Cross, swimming well enough to save your life includes five basic skills.\n\nFirst, make sure you can jump into water, submerge yourself completely and bring yourself to the surface.\n\nOnce you've returned to the surface, float or tread water for one minute. When treading water, stay relaxed so you don't overexert yourself.\n\nFrom there, you'll want to be able to turn around in a full circle and find an exit. Jones says knowing how to get out of the water is \"just as important as getting into the water.\"\n\nNext, swim 25 yards to an exit without stopping. You can use whichever stroke you're comfortable with. Jones adds that most pools in the U.S. are 25 yards.\n\nFinally, make sure you can exit the pool or body of water without a ladder. Jones used the phrase \"elbow, elbow, tummy, knee, knee\" to teach his three-year-old son this skill.\n\nLife Kit \n4 exercises that can prevent (and relieve!) pain from computer slouching and more\n\nLife Kit \n4 exercises that can prevent (and relieve!) pain from computer slouching and more\n\nLife Kit \n4 exercises that can prevent (and relieve!) pain from computer slouching and more\n\n\"You're putting both elbows up on the surface, [and] lifting yourself up to your stomach so you're halfway out.\" From there, you bring one knee up and then the other knee up, says Jones. \"Then you should be able to stand up.\"\n\nOnce you feel like a confident swimmer and can complete the five water safety basics, Jones says to share your skills with others. \"Immediately teach someone that you care about how to swim.\"\n\nThe audio portion of this episode was hosted by Marielle Segarra, produced by Margaret Cirino and edited by  Meghan Keane.",

Janet Mills refused to follow an executive order banning transgender athletes from school sports.\n\nIn a now famous exchange, Trump told Mills, \"you're not going to get any federal funding at all\" if her state refused to follow the administration's interpretation of sex-discrimination laws.

The money is supposed to help schools serve students who need more support to succeed, including those from low-income families, English language learners and students with disabilities.\n\nSibilia says while those federal dollars may seem like an expendable fraction of a school budget, \"it actually becomes very tangible when you think about laying off 1 out of 10 teachers, when you think about reducing teacher salaries, when you think about reducing the number of classrooms in a school. That all becomes very real.\"\n\nBarbara Welch has been an educator in the MSAD 54 district for nearly four decades.

The state of Maine participates in several U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs that provide free meals at school. Students who attend MSAD 54's after-school programs also receive a substantial snack.\n\nBut in April, the Trump administration froze funding for school meals over its legal battle with the state. Maine prevailed in the litigation, and funds were restored. Still, the incident created a sense that the administration's threats can quickly become reality.\n\n\"There's certainly a fear, and it comes up frequently in conversations with community members. For example, 'What are you going to do if this is cut, or that is cut?' \" says Moody.\n\nSchool mental health services have been similarly at risk in Maine and across the country.\n\nCatharine Biddle, who studies rural education at the University of Maine, says families in the state frequently encounter long waitlists for private mental health services for their children. Trained school clinicians can often meet students' needs faster, and at no cost to families.\n\nA fifth-grader at Mill Stream plays with a fidget toy in her counselor Jordan Chighali's office.\n                \n                    \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Greta Rybus for NPR\n\nA fifth-grader at Mill Stream plays with a fidget toy in her counselor Jordan Chighali's office.\n                \n                    \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Greta Rybus for NPR\n\nA fifth-grader at Mill Stream plays with a fidget toy in her counselor Jordan Chighali's office.\n                \n                    \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nA fifth-grader at Mill Stream plays with a fidget toy in her counselor Jordan Chighali's office.\n                \n                    \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nA fifth-grader at Mill Stream plays with a fidget toy in her counselor Jordan Chighali's office.\n                \n                    \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\"So schools are this really, really important funnel for resources, for families, and they need funds to be able to deliver those services,\" Biddle says.\n\nMSAD 54 was able to hire three licensed counselors after the federal government began sending grant money to schools for mental health services through the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.\n\nEducation \nEducation Department stops $1 billion in funding for school mental health\n\nEducation \nEducation Department stops $1 billion in funding for school mental health\n\nEducation \nEducation Department stops $1 billion in funding for school mental health\n\nJordan Chighali is one of those counselors.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of anxiety, more depression, parents maybe struggling with substance use,\" she says.

In the meantime, counselors like Chighali will likely have to reduce the number of students they can see.\n\nDespite recent developments, Moody remains optimistic that the federal cuts won't continue.\n\n\"Federal funding of education is an investment worth making. It changes lives,\" he says. \"It absolutely is essential.\"\n\nRadio story edited by: Steve Drummond and Lauren MigakiDigital story edited by: Nicole CohenRadio story produced by: Janet Woojeong LeeVisual design and development by: Mhari Shaw",

Like many places in Khartoum, electric cables had been ripped from walls and looted for copper, with the plastic remains left behind in heaps on the ground.\n\nIn their almost two-year occupation of Khartoum, RSF were accused by several human rights groups of systemic sexual violence and torture, denying or restricting movement in and out of the capital.\n\nIn the absence of health care in Khartoum, the sick and the wounded were trapped with nowhere to go for medical attention.\n\nVolunteer Duaa Tariq and her one-year-old son.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n\nVolunteer Duaa Tariq and her one-year-old son.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n\nVolunteer Duaa Tariq and her one-year-old son.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nVolunteer Duaa Tariq and her one-year-old son.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nVolunteer Duaa Tariq and her one-year-old son.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nWith international aid blocked or limited, a network of volunteers stepped in. The Emergency Response Rooms, a Nobel peace prize nominated network of local volunteers across Sudan, were a lifeline in Khartoum. The groups, set up in local areas, provided medical aid, counselling and set up community kitchens funded by local and diaspora donations to distribute food.\n\nDuaa Tariq is a volunteer who stayed in Khartoum during the war. She said the help ERR provided made a difference but often it wasn't enough. Reports were rife of people who died from a lack of basic medical services, including someone she was close to. \"Her name was Auntie Magda,\" she told us.\n\n\"We were eating only lentil soup with rice for over a year,\" she said, because it was cheap to buy but the lack of balance in her diet caused issues with her kidney and she became malnourished. \"When I went to see her, I couldn't recognize her. She was just skin and bones.\" In January Magda passed away.\n\nDr .Sara Abdurahaman at Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital treats an 8-month old baby in the critical care unit of a malnutrition ward.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n\nDr .Sara Abdurahaman at Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital treats an 8-month old baby in the critical care unit of a malnutrition ward.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n\nDr .Sara Abdurahaman at Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital treats an 8-month old baby in the critical care unit of a malnutrition ward.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nDr .Sara Abdurahaman at Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital treats an 8-month old baby in the critical care unit of a malnutrition ward.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nDr .Sara Abdurahaman at Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital treats an 8-month old baby in the critical care unit of a malnutrition ward.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nWith the collapse of health care in Khartoum and other parts of Sudan, people have streamed into cities where the health system has been partially restored, like Omdurman.\n\nAl-Buluk Hospital in Omdurman is supported by the Sudanese American Physicians Association and Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The hospital has been repeatedly struck by artillery throughout the conflict. Patients and medical staff have been injured and killed, but it has stayed open.\n\nDr. Ahmed Khojeli is the director of Al Buluk and has worked at the hospital throughout the war. He said patient numbers there have surged. \"It's getting higher, definitely, because, the daily admissions are [in the] 50s to 60s, but now we've reached 80s and 90s and last Friday it was a hundred,\" he said in mid-April.\n\nEach ward designed for 25 children now holds two to three times that number, many in need of urgent care. About one in every 25 children brought to the hospital dies, according to Dr. Khojeli most from severe malnutrition.\n\nThis week, the Sudanese army said it officially recaptured the entire capital region, after recapturing the capital city, Khartoum at the end of March.\n\nAuthorities have begun reviving hospitals shutdown during the war, or repairing facilities damaged by the conflict. But the rebuilding effort is taking place under the cover of increasing RSF drone strikes over the past month.\n\nAl Buluk has been repeatedly struck by artillery during the war. Medical staff and patients have been killed, but it has remained open. Its wards are overflowing with patients, many of whom have traveled miles in search of care, navigating frontlines and shelling, like Zakaria.\n\nShe escaped Khartoum before the army recaptured it. The RSF were still in control of her neighborhood when she fled, carrying her baby and walking for hours across the city, as the sound of gunfire and bombing echoed all around her.\n\nAlawiya Zakaria  and two women and their children in a packed malnutrition ward in Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n\nAlawiya Zakaria  and two women and their children in a packed malnutrition ward in Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\n\n        \n        Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n\nAlawiya Zakaria  and two women and their children in a packed malnutrition ward in Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\n\ntoggle caption\n\nAlawiya Zakaria  and two women and their children in a packed malnutrition ward in Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nAlawiya Zakaria  and two women and their children in a packed malnutrition ward in Al-Buluk Pediatric Hospital.\n                \n                    \n                    Faiz Abubakr for NPR\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nShe passed through more than a dozen checkpoints mounted across Khartoum by the RSF.\n\nAt several checkpoints, she showed them Sabba's condition but was interrogated and abused. \"I was slapped, beaten. They robbed my money and my phone, all my things,\" she said. But eventually she was allowed to pass. And after a month of care, doctors at Al Buluk say 1-year-old Sabba is gaining weight and responding to treatment. It was her mother's courage that saved her.",

He went on to found the award-winning politics and culture blog PostBourgie before joining NPR in 2012. Gene is a native of South Philadelphia and an avid runner. He hopes to stay healthy long enough to see his beloved Sixers win an NBA championship.\n\nYou can read Gene's stories here, and follow him on X at @geedee215.\n\nB.A. Parker is a co-host of NPR's Code Switch. She joined the team in July of 2022 and has expertly covered racial trauma in horror films, honoring her ancestors, and the myth behind self-care.\n\nIn a previous life, Parker was a film professor at Morgan State University and Stevenson University, where she forced 19-year-olds to watch Point Break and Wong Kar-wai films.  She then found her way to a production fellowship with This American Life, which she still can't believe happened. She has also been a guest host of NPR's It's Been a Minute and has produced for NPR's Invisibilia, Gimlet's Heavyweight and WNYC's Nancy. In 2019, she was selected for the Third Coast Radio Residency at Ragdale.\n\nParker hails from Baltimore, and currently lives in Brooklyn, NY. You can hear some of her ramblings here, and follow her @aparkusfarce on IG and X.\n\nLori Lizarraga is the co-host of Code Switch. Before public radio, Lori's career was in television. Her work as a local news reporter and evening anchor took her to newsrooms in Texas, California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and abroad on international assignment in Ecuador to become an Emmy and Murrow award-winning broadcast reporter. She left local TV news in 2021 to pursue race and justice reporting full time as an independent journalist. Her investigative reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic uncovered discrimination in local news that resulted in new standards of immigration coverage at newsrooms across the country.\n\nIn 2022, Lori became co-host of Code Switch at NPR, bringing her background in breaking news and a reputation for covering under-reported communities – particularly Latinos in the U.S. – to public radio.\n\nYou can listen to Lori's work here, and follow her on social media at @lorilizarraga.\n\nDalia Mortada is the managing editor and showrunner of Code Switch. She's a (racially ambiguous) child of Syrian immigrants who's lived on three continents and has spent her life straddling cultures, languages, and lived experiences.\n\nBefore joining the Code Switch massive in 2022, she developed editorial strategy for NPR's listening app, edited for NPR's Morning Edition and spent many (literally) sleepless nights editing Up First. She joined NPR in 2018 after living in Istanbul, Turkey, for seven years, where she reported on the Syrian war and refugee crisis, Turkish politics and society, food, fashion, music and more. In her life beyond work, you'll likely find Dalia outside (usually in the mountains) and/or cooking.\n\nYou can read Leah's stories here, and follow her on X at @AskLeezul.\n\nChristina Cala is Code Switch's senior producer. She's a proud Colombiana who strives to put more languages, more accents, and more ways of telling stories in ears everywhere. There's a special spot in her heart for stories about immigrant and indigenous communities, social and climate justice, and all things poetic or musical.\n\nBefore coming to Code Switch, she produced and sometimes edited the TED Radio Hour and All Things Considered. Her reporting on the US-Mexican border was part of a 2019 Edward R. Murrow award-winning package. She's an inaugural Edit Mode fellow and a co-founder of NPR's MGIPOC mentorship program. In 2021, she ran Code Switch's reporting fellowships. When not working, she can be found backpacking, taking all too many pictures, reading a novel a week or making pottery.\n\nYou can listen to Christina's stories here.\n\nYou can find Jess's stories here.\n\nBefore working in journalism, Xavier worked in the non-profit world in Queens, NY, where he was raised and currently resides. He is a fan of the beach, long walks, sad music, cats, and raccoons.\n\nYou can follow him on X at @xalopez.\n\nVeralyn Williams (she/her) is the executive producer of  Code Switch and It's Been a Minute. She's Peabody and Edward R. Murrow award-winning journalist who has been asking hard questions about our world since she picked up her first microphone in 2004.\n\nWant to pitch us? Here's how.
